I didn't realize how overpowering the music would be even though I turned it way down. So on the video all I say while the music is playin in the menu at the begining is that I added the menu scene and the music on the menu scene as 2 of my extra elements to the game, then I say that if you click the quit button it'll display in the debug window and if you click the play button it'll load the main game scene. Then when I load the menu again I say that it takes you back to the menu after 5 seconds where you can again choose quit or play to keep playing the game.
