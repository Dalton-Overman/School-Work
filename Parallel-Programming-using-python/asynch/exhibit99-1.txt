              K-TRON REPORTS $0.34 PER SHARE FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

Pitman,  New  Jersey  -  -  April  17,  2003  -  -  K-Tron  International,  Inc.
(NASDAQ-KTII) today reported first quarter 2003 net income of $0.835 million, or
$0.34 per share (diluted),  on revenues of $23.40 million compared to net income
of $0.751 million,  or $0.31 per share (diluted),  on revenues of $16.78 million
for the same period in 2002.

In announcing  the above  results,  the Company  pointed out that if the average
foreign  currency  exchange  rates for the first quarter of 2002 were applied to
the  first  quarter  of  2003,  the  Company's  revenues  would  have  increased
approximately 29 percent instead of approximately 39 percent, and its net income
and earnings  per share in the first  quarter of 2003 would have been lower than
reported.  This is the result of a significantly weaker U.S. dollar in the first
three  months of 2003  compared  to the same  period of 2002  against  the Swiss
franc, the euro and other relevant foreign currencies.

Commenting on the Company's results, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Edward B. Cloues,  II said,  "K-Tron's ten percent  earnings per share  increase
over the first  quarter  of 2002 was a solid  performance  in a  generally  poor
global economy,  particularly for the purchase of industrial  capital equipment.
This increase  reflected  improved  margins in our feeder business in Europe and
Asia and favorable foreign exchange rates, and it was achieved despite very weak
demand  for  our  feeder  equipment  in the  United  States.  As  expected,  our
Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation subsidiary, which was acquired at the beginning
of this year's first  quarter,  made a positive  contribution  to earnings  even
though sales of its size  reduction and other  equipment  were also below normal
levels."

In addition to his  comments on  operating  results,  Mr.  Cloues noted that the
Company's cash position had strengthened  from $2.694 million at the end of 2002
to $4.325 million at the end of the first quarter.  He also pointed out that the
acquisition of Pennsylvania  Crusher and its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Jeffrey
Specialty  Equipment  Corporation,  had broadened and  diversified the Company's
bulk solids material handling  equipment  business and reduced its dependence on
some of the more cyclical  markets  traditionally  served,  such as plastics and
chemicals.

K-Tron  International,  Inc. and its subsidiaries  design,  produce,  market and
service material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industrial
markets.  The  Company  has  manufacturing  facilities  in  the  United  States,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada, and its equipment is sold throughout
the world.
