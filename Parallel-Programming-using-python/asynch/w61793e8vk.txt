         Item 4.  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

                  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of K-Tron
         International, Inc. ("K-Tron") annually considers and recommends to the
         Board the selection of K-Tron's independent public accountants. As
         recommended by K-Tron's Audit Committee, the Board of Directors on June
         22, 2002 decided to no longer engage Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen")
         as K-Tron's independent public accountants and has engaged KPMG LLP to
         serve as K-Tron's independent public accountants for the fiscal year
         ending 28 December 2002.

                  Andersen's reports on K-Tron's consolidated financial
         statements for the past two years did not contain an adverse opinion or
         disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to
         uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

                  During K-Tron's two most recent fiscal years and through the
         date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any
         matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
         disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to
         Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the
         subject matter in connection with its report on K-Tron's consolidated
         financial statements for such years. There were no reportable events as
         listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

                  K-Tron has provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing
         disclosure. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of Andersen's letter,
         dated June 26, 2002, stating its agreement with such statements.

                  During K-Tron's two most recent fiscal years and through the
         date of this Form 8-K, K-Tron did not consult with KPMG LLP with
         respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified
         transaction, either completed or posed, or the type of audit opinion
         that might be rendered on K-Tron's consolidated financial statements,
         or any other matters or reportable events listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i)
         and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
