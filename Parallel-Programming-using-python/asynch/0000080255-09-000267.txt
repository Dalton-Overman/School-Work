           trustee bank has the right to receive dividends paid
           with respect to, and proceeds from the sale of, such
           securities.

           The ultimate power to direct the receipt of dividends
           paid with respect to, and the proceeds from the sale
           of, such securities, is vested in the individual and
           institutional clients which Price Associates serves as
           investment adviser.  Any and all discretionary
           authority which has been delegated to Price Associates
           may be revoked in whole or in part at any time.

           Except as may be indicated if this is a joint filing
           with one of the registered investment companies
           sponsored by Price Associates which it also serves as
           investment adviser ("T. Rowe Price Funds"), not more
           than 5% of the class of such securities is owned by
           any one client subject to the investment advice of
           Price Associates.

           Rowe Price Funds, only State Street Bank and Trust
           Company, as custodian for each of such Funds, has the
           right to receive dividends paid with respect to, and
           proceeds from the sale of, such securities.  No other
           person is known to have such right, except that the

           proportionately in any dividends and distributions so
           paid.

         ownership is expressly denied.

                           Signature.

         After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my (our)
