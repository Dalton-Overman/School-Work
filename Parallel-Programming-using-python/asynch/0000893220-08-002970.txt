</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-Tron and the Employee are parties to an Employment Agreement dated as of October&nbsp;6, 1997, as
amended (the &#147;<U>Existing Agreement</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-Tron and the Employee desire to amend the Existing Agreement in various respects, including
to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree that the
Existing Agreement is amended and restated as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Employment</U>. K-Tron agrees to employ the Employee, and the Employee accepts such
employment and agrees to perform his duties and responsibilities hereunder, in accordance with the

Existing Agreement commenced on January&nbsp;5, 1998. Under this Agreement, the Employment Term shall
continue until terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 or 9 hereof, provided that if a Change of

occur of (i)&nbsp;the date that is one year after the Change of Control or (ii)&nbsp;March&nbsp;15 following the
end of the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs, unless earlier terminated in
accordance with Section&nbsp;8 or 9 hereof.

responsibilities, it being understood that substantially all of his business time shall be devoted
to K-Tron and to other activities of a type that might typically be performed by the chairman and
chief executive officer of a company such as K-Tron. Without limiting other activities in which the
Employee may be or become involved, it is recognized by K-Tron that the Employee shall continue as
the non-executive Chairman of the Board of AMREP Corporation.

of the Existing Agreement, which shall be payable in installments at such times as K-Tron
customarily pays its other senior level executives (but in no event less often than monthly). Such
Base Salary may be increased from time to time during the Employment Term in the sole discretion of
the Board of Directors of K-Tron (the &#147;<U>K-Tron Board</U>&#148;) or any duly authorized committee
thereof, and any such increased salary shall thereafter be the Employee&#146;s new Base Salary for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Employee shall also be entitled to receive bonus payments in the
sole discretion of the K-Tron Board or any duly authorized committee thereof.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;In addition to such annual salary and bonus payments (if any), the Employee shall be

receive under any K-Tron group plan, and (ii)&nbsp;disability insurance providing coverage equal to
$30,000 per month (or a lesser amount, if the Employee so agrees) through age 70, and he shall also
be reimbursed for the estimated federal, state and local income and FICA taxes to be incurred on
such reimbursements. The definition of disability shall be that the Employee is unable to perform
his duties as the chief executive officer of K-Tron. K-Tron and the Employee acknowledge that the
term life and disability coverages under this Section&nbsp;1.4(c) are satisfied by the term life
insurance policy which the Employee has purchased from AXA Equitable and the QQ series Disability
Income Policy which the Employee has purchased from Northwestern Mutual Life.

jurisdiction. The Employee hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that he may now or hereafter have to such jurisdiction or to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that such suit, action or
proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Employee agrees that effective service of
process may be made upon him by mail under the notice provisions contained in Section&nbsp;14 hereof and

award entered by the arbitrators shall be final, binding and nonappealable (except as provided by
applicable statutory law), and judgment may be entered thereon by either party in accordance with
applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be
specifically enforceable. The arbitrators shall have no authority to modify any provision of this
Agreement or to award a remedy for a dispute involving this Agreement other than a benefit
specifically provided under or by virtue of the Agreement. If the Employee prevails on any material
issue which is the subject of such arbitration or lawsuit, K-Tron shall be responsible for all of
the fees of the AAA and the arbitrators and any expenses relating to the conduct of the arbitration
