             K-TRON REPORTS $ 0.35 PER SHARE SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS

Pitman, New Jersey - - July 17, 2003 - - K-Tron International, Inc.
(NASDAQ-KTII) today reported second quarter 2003 net income of $0.865 million,
or $0.35 per share (diluted), on revenues of $22.66 million compared to net
income of $0.814 million, or $0.33 per share (diluted), on revenues of $16.88
million for the same period in 2002.

For the first six months of 2003, K-Tron reported net income of $1.700 million,
or $0.68 per share (diluted), on revenues of $46.06 million compared to $1.565
million, or $0.64 per share (diluted), on revenues of $33.66 million for the
same period in 2002.

In announcing the above results, the Company pointed out that if the average
foreign currency exchange rates for the second quarter and first six months of
2002 were applied to the same periods in 2003, the Company's revenues would have
increased approximately 26 percent for the second quarter of 2003 instead of 34
percent and would have increased approximately 27 percent for the first six
months of 2003 instead of 37 percent, in each case compared to the numbers
reported for the same periods in 2002, and its net income and earnings per share
in those periods in 2003 would have been lower than reported. This is the result
of a significantly weaker U.S. dollar in the first six months of 2003 compared
to the same period of 2002 against the Swiss franc, the euro and other relevant
foreign currencies.

Commenting on the Company's results, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Edward B. Cloues, II said, "K-Tron's earnings per share of $0.35 for the second
quarter was a six percent improvement over last year's second quarter and a
three percent improvement over this year's first quarter. This was a good
performance considering the adverse global business environment in which we have
been operating, including continued very weak spending for industrial capital
equipment and disruptions caused by the war in Iraq and the SARS scare. While
the above factors were primarily responsible for lower revenues and profits in
the feeder and pneumatic conveying parts of our material handling business in
the second quarter and first six months of 2003 versus the same periods last
year, a significant positive contribution from the size reduction part of our
business which was added with the January 2, 2003 Penn Crusher acquisition
enabled us to report higher overall revenues and profits in both the second
quarter and first half of 2003."

In addition to his comments on operating results, Mr. Cloues noted that K-Tron's
worldwide cash increased by $1.625 million in the second quarter, from $4.325
million at the end of the first quarter to $5.950 million at the end of the
second quarter. During the same period, there was also a $1.203 million
reduction in debt, from $32.419 million to $31.216 million. Mr. Cloues further
pointed out that in the first six months of fiscal 2003, the Company's cash
position increased by $3.256 million, from $2.694 million at the end of last
year to $5.950 million at the end of the first half. Foreign exchange was not a
significant factor in any of these changes.

K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries design, produce, market and
service material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industrial
markets. The Company has manufacturing facilities in the United States,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada, and its equipment is sold throughout
the world.
