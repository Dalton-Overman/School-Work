Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

Base Salaries. On March 4, 2005, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee
(the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of K-Tron International, Inc. (the
"Company") approved base salaries, effective April 4, 2005, for the executive
officers of the Company in the amounts indicated below:

                                                 Base
      Name                                   Salary Amount
      ----                                   -------------

Edward B. Cloues, II                           $484,500
Kevin C. Bowen                                 $233,000
Lukas Guenthardt                               $206,000
Donald W. Melchiorre                           $220,000
Ronald R. Remick                               $222,700

Annual Incentive Awards. On March 4, 2005, the Committee approved annual
incentive awards for 2004, payable in cash, to the same executive officers, as
follows:

                                                 Annual
      Name                                   Incentive Award
      ----                                   ---------------

Edward B. Cloues, II                           $380,000
Kevin C. Bowen                                 $120,000
Lukas Guenthardt                               $ 75,675
Donald W. Melchiorre                           $107,625
Ronald R. Remick                               $109,000


The annual incentive awards were made pursuant to bonus guidelines used in the
preparation of the Company's budget for 2004. Although the budget was approved
by the Board of Directors, including both members of the Committee, the
Committee retained full discretion to make such specific incentive bonus awards,
if any, as it deemed appropriate, after the end of the year. The awards made
were based on the Company's achievement of its earnings per share target for
2004, the amount of pre-tax income generated by the Company in excess of what
was necessary to achieve that earnings per share target and the assessed
contribution of each executive to the Company's success. As a starting point,
the Committee considered the target bonus for each executive used in the 2004
budget, which was the same target bonus used for the past several years. This
target was 50% of base salary for Mr. Cloues, the Company's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and 30% of base salary for the other executive officers, but
the annual incentive award for any executive may be more or less than the
applicable target, depending on the Company's financial performance, the
Committee's assessment of the executive's contribution and such other factors as
the Committee may choose to consider.
