ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

(a) On January 2, 2003, K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron"), through its
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary PCC Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation
("Acquisition Co."), acquired all of the outstanding capital stock (the "PCC
Stock") of Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("PCC"),
from John D. Whalen, Donald J. Carrozzino, Frank Wallitsch, Jr. and Nancy S.
Hansen (the "Stockholders"). The acquisition of the PCC Stock was made pursuant
to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "PCC Stock Purchase Agreement") dated January
2, 2003 by and among Acquisition Co. and the Stockholders. The PCC Stock
Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by
reference. On January 3, 2003, Acquisition Co. was merged with and into PCC,
with PCC being the surviving corporation.

      As a result of the purchase of the PCC Stock, PCC's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Jeffrey Specialty Equipment Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Jeffrey"), is now also an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of K-Tron.

      The purchase price paid for the PCC Stock was $23.5 million, subject to a
post-closing adjustment based on PCC's consolidated stockholders' equity at
December 31, 2002. Of this amount, $19.5 million was paid in cash to the
Stockholders, and K-Tron issued an aggregate of $4 million in unsecured
promissory notes to the Stockholders (the "Stockholder Notes"). The principal of
the Stockholder Notes is payable in three equal, annual installments on the
second, third and fourth anniversaries of the closing date. With respect to the
payment of the cash portion of the purchase price and related acquisition
expenses, $15 million of this amount was financed through a secured credit
facility from National City Bank directly to PCC with no recourse to K-Tron.
This credit facility is secured by all of the real property, personal property
and other assets of PCC and Jeffrey, including a pledge by K-Tron Investment
Co., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of K-Tron, of the stock of PCC. The total
amount of the PCC facility with National City Bank is $17 million, leaving an
additional $2 million of availability under the revolving credit line, subject
to certain conditions, for working capital purposes. Additionally, K-Tron
America, Inc., another K-Tron indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary ("K-Tron
America"), borrowed $5 million from The Bank, a subsidiary of Fulton Financial
Corporation, which money was used to pay part of the purchase price for the PCC
Stock. This loan, which was combined with another $2.333 million
then-outstanding loan from The Bank to K-Tron America, is secured by the real
property, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of K-Tron America (with
limited exceptions), and its repayment by K-Tron America is guaranteed by
K-Tron.

(b) PCC has its headquarters in Broomall, Pennsylvania, and a manufacturing
facility in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. It manufactures size reduction and related
equipment which is sold to electric utilities to crush coal for use in
coal-fired power generation plants and also to companies in other industries
such as quarries where the crushing of material is required. Jeffrey is located
in Woodruff, South Carolina, where it manufactures chip sizer mills, industrial
hammermills and other size reduction equipment for use in the paper and pulp
industries to crush wood in the production of paper and also in other industries
for crushing applications. Jeffrey also makes large-scale vibratory feeders for
coal, minerals,


                                       2

chemicals and other bulk materials. A significant portion of the revenues of
both PCC and Jeffrey comes from the sale of spare parts. Following the
acquisition, K-Tron will continue to operate both businesses.
