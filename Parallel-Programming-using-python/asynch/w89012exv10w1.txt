                       AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO CREDIT AGREEMENT
                       (PENNSYLVANIA CRUSHER CORPORATION)

                  AMENDMENT NO. 1, dated as of May 12, 2003, (this "AMENDMENT
NO. 1") among PENNSYLVANIA CRUSHER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"BORROWER"); the financial institutions referred to as "LENDERS" in the Credit
Agreement referred to below (the "LENDERS"); and National City Bank, as agent
for the Lenders (together with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the
"AGENT").

                                   Background

                  The Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent entered into a certain
Credit Agreement, dated as of January 3, 2003, (the "EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT"
and the same, as it may be further amended, restated, modified and/or
supplemented from time to time, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), which provides for
certain extensions of credit to the Borrower, subject to certain conditions.

                  The Borrower has requested that the Lenders agree to modify
the definition of "Base Amount" in the Existing Credit Agreement so that the
Amount will be based on the Borrower's financial statements for the first fiscal
quarter of 2003. The Agent and the Lenders are willing to make the amendments
requested by the Borrower pursuant to the terms, and subject to the conditions,
specified below. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows.

                  SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS. Except as otherwise defined in this
Amendment No. 1, terms defined in the Existing Credit Agreement are used herein
as defined therein.

                  SECTION 2. AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. Subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified in Section 4 below,

                           2.1.1 Section 6.1 of the Existing Credit Agreement
(Minimum Tangible Net Worth) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                                    The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a
                  Consolidated basis, shall maintain a Tangible Net Worth of not
                  less the sum of (a) the Base Amount (as defined below) plus
                  (b) an amount equal to 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of
                  the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the period commencing on
                  the first day of the second fiscal quarter of the Borrower's
                  2003 fiscal year and ending on the last day of the fiscal
                  quarter ending on, or most recently prior to, the applicable
                  test date. Test dates for this covenant shall be the last day
                  of each fiscal quarter commencing with the second fiscal
                  quarter in the 2003 fiscal year. "BASE AMOUNT" means the
                  Tangible Net Worth of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at
                  the last day of the first fiscal quarter of 2003.
