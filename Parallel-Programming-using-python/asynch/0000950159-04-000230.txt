             K-TRON REPORTS $0.44 PER SHARE FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS

Pitman,  New  Jersey  - -  February  23,  2004 - -  K-Tron  International,  Inc.
(NASDAQ-KTII)  today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and for the
full year 2003. For the fourth  quarter of 2003, net income was $1.113  million,
or $0.44 per share  (diluted),  on  revenues of $26.46  million  compared to net
income of $0.883 million,  or $0.36 per share  (diluted),  on revenues of $17.67
million for the same period in 2002.

For fiscal  2003,  K-Tron  reported net income of $3.723  million,  or $1.49 per
share (diluted),  on revenues of $94.68 million  compared to $3.284 million,  or
$1.33 per share (diluted), on revenues of $68.23 million in fiscal 2002.

In announcing  the above  results,  the Company  pointed out that if the average
foreign  currency  exchange  rates for the fourth quarter and all of fiscal 2002
were applied to the same periods in fiscal 2003,  the Company's  revenues  would
have increased  approximately  43 percent for the fourth quarter of 2003 instead
of almost 50 percent and would have increased  approximately  31 percent for the
full  year 2003  instead  of nearly 39  percent,  in each case  compared  to the
numbers  reported for the same periods in 2002,  and the gains in its net income
and earnings per share in those periods in 2003 over the  corresponding  numbers
in 2002  would have been lower  than  reported.  This is due to a  significantly
weaker U.S.  dollar in 2003  compared to 2002 against the Swiss franc,  the euro
and other relevant foreign currencies.

Commenting on the Company's results, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Edward B. Cloues,  II said,  "K-Tron finished the year 2003 with a strong fourth
quarter  performance.  Net income was up 26 percent over 2002's fourth  quarter,
and earnings per share for the quarter increased by 22.2 percent year over year.
For the full  year,  net income  rose by 13.4  percent  to $3.723  million,  and
earnings per share improved by 12 percent to $1.49 per share.  These comparisons
include higher interest costs in 2003  attributable to acquisition  debt as well
as higher taxes in 2003 due to a larger proportion of U.S. based income.

"In the fourth quarter of 2003, we continued to benefit from the positive impact
of the Pennsylvania  Crusher  acquisition made in January of 2003. For the year,
Penn Crusher's  contribution  to our net income and earnings per share more than
offset the lower profit  levels in other parts of our business  compared to 2002
which resulted from generally weak capital equipment  spending by our customers.
Fourth quarter revenues of almost $26.5 million were

<PAGE>


substantially higher than 2002's fourth quarter revenues,  which did not include
Penn  Crusher.  They were also well above  revenues  for each of the first three
quarters  in 2003,  which did  include  Penn  Crusher.  While part of the fourth
quarter  increase  over  each  of the  preceding  three  quarters  of  2003  was
attributable  to  changes in foreign  exchange  rates,  most of it was driven by
higher sales across all parts of our material handling business,  especially our
overseas  feeder   business.   This  is  a  very  encouraging   sign,   although
sustainability has yet to be demonstrated in our marketplaces."

Mr.  Cloues also  pointed out that the  Company's  net book value per share rose
from  $11.69  at the end of  fiscal  2002 to  $14.35  at the end of  2003.  This
increase,  which  was  nearly  1.8 times  the  earnings  per share for the year,
reflected  the  impact  of a weaker  U.S.  dollar on the  translation  into U.S.
dollars of the equity of K-Tron's foreign subsidiaries.

Mr. Cloues further noted that while debt for the year increased by $19.6 million
from $8.5 million at the end of 2002 to $28.1  million at the end of 2003,  this
increase was primarily caused by the addition of $24 million in acquisition debt
for Penn Crusher in January of 2003.  Debt following the acquisition was reduced
significantly by $4.3 million from $32.4 million at the end of the first quarter
of 2003 to $28.1  million  at the end of the  year  with a minor  effect  due to
foreign exchange rate changes.  As a result of this reduction in debt as well as
the increase in net book value previously described, the Company's debt-to-total
capitalization  ratio was reduced  from 0.52 at the end of the first  quarter of
2003 to 0.44 at year end. At the same time,  cash  increased  by $1.8 million in
2003,  from $2.7 million to $4.5 million,  with foreign  exchange making a small
contribution to this increase.

K-Tron  International,  Inc. and its subsidiaries  design,  produce,  market and
service material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industrial
markets.  The  Company  has  manufacturing  facilities  in  the  United  States,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada, and its equipment is sold throughout
the world.
