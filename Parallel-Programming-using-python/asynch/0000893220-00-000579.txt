                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                   (Unaudited)

1.       Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("K-Tron" or the "Company").
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
been made. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2000 which
was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Cash paid in the first three months of 2000 and 1999 for interest was $0.1
million and $0.1 million, respectively, and for income taxes was $0.2 million
and $0.0 million, respectively.

3.       Earnings per Share

The Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," which requires that the
Company report Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share. Basic Earnings Per Share
represents net income less preferred dividends divided by the weighted average
common shares outstanding. Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated similarly,
except that the denominator includes weighted average common shares outstanding
plus the dilutive effect of options, warrants, convertible securities and other
instruments with dilutive effects if exercised.

The Company's Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share are calculated as follows:

</TABLE>

Diluted earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding during a given time period. Such
average shares include the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
plus the shares issuable upon exercise of stock options after the assumed
repurchase of common shares with the related proceeds.

4.       Comprehensive Income

The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and
its components. Comprehensive income is the total of net income and the current
year change in cumulative translation adjustments, which is the only nonowner
change in equity. For the three months in the periods ended April 1, 2000 and
April 3, 1999, the following table sets forth the Company's comprehensive
income:

5.       Management Segment Information

The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information," which introduced a new model for segment reporting
called the management approach. The management approach is based on the way that
the chief operating decision maker organizes segments within a company for
making operating decisions and assessing performance.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Results of Operations

         For the first three months of 2000 and 1999, the Company reported net
income of $1,373,000 and $1,360,000, respectively.

         K-Tron is an international company which derived approximately 53% and
63% of its first quarter 2000 and 1999 revenues, respectively, from products
manufactured in, and services performed from, its facilities located outside the
United States, primarily in Europe. As such, the financial position and
performance of the Company is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates ("foreign exchange rates"), which can affect both the translation of
financial statement items into U.S. dollars and the impact of transactions where
the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different
currencies, such as sales made from the Company's Swiss manufacturing facilities
in currencies other than the Swiss franc.

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

         More than half of the Company's revenues are normally derived from
activities in foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, the Company's results can be
significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in
U.S. dollar exchange rates with respect to the Swiss franc, German mark and euro
and, to a lesser degree, the British pound sterling, French franc and other
currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S.
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. dollar
weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based
sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based
costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar
strengthens. Overall, the Company typically receives a majority of its revenues
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker
dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major
currencies worldwide, especially those identified above. Accordingly, changes in
foreign exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar,
may adversely affect the Company's total revenues, gross profit and operating
income as expressed in U.S. dollars.

         In addition, revenues and income of the Company with respect to
particular transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates
where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the
facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale, including in particular
the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc (for inter-company transactions) and the euro/Swiss
franc and German mark/Swiss franc (for sales from the Company's Swiss
manufacturing facilities which are made in euros or German marks) exchange
rates. For the first three months of each of 2000 and 1999, the changes in these
and the U.S. dollar/euro and U.S. dollar/German mark exchange rates were as
follows:

         Total revenues increased $0.4 million or 2.3% in the first quarter of
2000 compared to the same period in 1999. North American revenues increased and
Western European revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2000 compared to the
same period in 1999. If the average foreign exchange rates for the first quarter
of 2000 were applied to the same period in 1999, total revenues would have
increased by $2.0 million or 10.8% for the quarter.

         Gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to 45.7% for the first
quarter of 2000 compared to 46.0% for the same period in 1999. The decrease in
gross margin in 2000 was primarily due to sales mix.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $0.3
million or 4.3% for the first quarter of 2000 compared to the same period in
1999. This decrease in SG&A in the first quarter was primarily due to lower
foreign exchange translation rates, partly offset by higher commissions on the
increased revenues. As a percent of total revenues, SG&A for the first quarter
of 2000 was 31.1%, compared to 33.3% for the same period in 1999.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures remained constant for the
first quarter of 2000 compared to the same period in 1999. R&D expenses
increased due to greater emphasis on the development of new products, offset by
lower foreign exchange translation rates. R&D expense as a percent of total
revenues was 4.1% for the first quarters of 2000 and 1999.

         Interest expense decreased by $12 thousand or 9.0% for the first
quarter 2000 compared to the same period in 1999, primarily due to lower foreign
exchange translation rates offset in part by the interest on funds borrowed in
March 2000 related to the Company's repurchase of 508 thousand shares of its
Common Stock, which is discussed in the liquidity section.

         The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2000 was 31.4%,
compared to 12.8% for the same period in 1999. These higher rates in 2000 were
due to increased taxable income in the United States as well as providing for
Swiss income taxes for the first time since fiscal 1992, as it is anticipated
that the remaining net operating loss in Switzerland will be fully utilized in
2000.

         The backlog of customer orders increased by 21.7% at the end of the
first quarter compared to the end of 1999 and decreased by 6.7% compared to the
same period in 1999, in each case at constant foreign exchange rates. The
increase was from orders received at the manufacturing facilities both in the
United States and in Switzerland. The decrease in the backlog as compared to the
first quarter of 1999 was due to the shipment of a large order in the fourth
quarter of 1999 that was included in the first quarter 1999 backlog, partly
offset by the increased orders noted above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         On March 23, 2000 the Company completed a tender offer begun on
February 16, 2000 and repurchased 508 thousand shares of its Common Stock at
$18.00 per share for a total cost of $9.244 million (including $100 thousand of
costs associated with the tender offer). The share purchase represented
approximately 17.3% of the Common Stock then outstanding. The purchase was
financed by using $1.194 million of available cash, all of a $7 million loan
facility obtained from a U.S. bank on February 4, 2000 and $950 thousand from an
existing $5 million line of credit with that same bank. The $7 million loan is
payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over a
period of four years commencing May 1, 2000 and is secured by liens on the same
collateral securing other loans from the same U.S. bank. One-half of the loan
bears interest at the fixed rate of 8.23% for the first two years and the other
half is subject to a variable rate of interest equal to one month LIBOR plus
1.85% (7.66% at the date of the borrowing). As of April 1, 2000 the Company had
repaid $550 thousand on the credit line and has a total of $7.4 milllion debt
outstanding associated with the share repurchase.

         The Company's capitalization as of the end of the first quarter of 2000
and as of the end of fiscal years 1999 and 1998 is set forth below:

         Total debt increased by $4.5 million in the first three months of 2000
($4.8 million using a constant foreign exchange rate). U.S. debt increased by
$7.3 million while debt in Switzerland decreased by $2.8 million. At April 1,
2000 the Company had $4.6 million of borrowing availability under its U.S. loan
agreements and $4.2 million of borrowing availability under its Swiss loan
agreements. The increase in the U.S. debt was due to the share repurchase
described above.

         At April 1, 2000, there was working capital of $11.1 million compared
to $14.1 million at January 1, 2000, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was 1.59 and 1.65, respectively. The decreases in
working capital and in the current ratio was primarily due to the increase in
short-term debt associated with the share repurchase.

         In the first three months of 2000 and 1999, the Company utilized
internally-generated funds to meet its working capital needs and used its bank
borrowings and available cash to complete the share repurchase.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 million in the first
three months of 2000 compared to $1.5 million in the same period of 1999, with
the increase being primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first three months of 2000
and 1999 was primarily for capital additions.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and German mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease in
shareholders' equity of $0.7 million in the first three months of 2000.

provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Company. The Company and its representatives may from time to time make
written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements
contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, reports to the Company's shareholders and news releases. All
statements that express expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. In addition, other
written or oral statements which constitute forward-looking statements may be
made by or on behalf of the Company. Words such as "expects," "anticipates,"
"intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "projects," "forecasts,"
"may," "should," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended
to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees
of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions
which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such
forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

         A wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and
the performance of the Company, including the following: (i) increasing price
and product/service competition by domestic and foreign competitors, including
new entrants; (ii) the mix of products/services sold by the Company; (iii) rapid
technological changes and developments and the Company's ability to continue to
introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost-effective basis; (iv)
changes in U.S. and global financial and currency markets, including significant
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; (v) protection
and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights, both of the
Company and its competitors; (vi) the cyclical nature of the Company's business
as a capital goods supplier; (vii) possible future litigation and governmental
proceedings; (viii) the availability of financing and financial resources in the
amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Company's future
business, including capacity expansions and possible acquisitions; (ix) the loss
of key customers, employees or suppliers; (x) the failure to carry out marketing
and sales plans; (xi) the failure successfully to integrate acquired businesses,
if any, into the Company without substantial costs, delays or other operational
or financial problems; (xii) economic, business and regulatory conditions and
changes which may affect the level of new investments and purchases made by
customers, including general economic and business conditions that are less
favorable than expected; and (xiii) domestic and international political and
economic conditions.

         This list of factors that may affect future performance and the
accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but it is by no means
exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with
the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.
