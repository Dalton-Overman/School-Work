                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)

1.       Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
been made. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 1996 which
was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash paid in the first
three months of 1997 and 1996 for interest was $.2 million and $.4 million,
respectively, and for income taxes was $.7 million and $.5 million,
respectively.

3.       Impact of New Accounting Pronouncement

In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share ("SFAS No. 128") which requires
the Company to present in the financial statements "basic" and "diluted"
earnings per share, as defined. SFAS No. 128 is effective for interim and annual
periods ending after December 15, 1997, however, "basic" and "diluted" earnings
per share as defined for the three month periods ended March 29, 1997 and March
30, 1996 would be $.33 and $.33; and $.24 and $.24, respectively, if SFAS No.
128 were adopted for those periods.

Results of Operations

         For the first three months of 1997 and 1996, the Company reported net
income of $1,050,000 and $752,000, respectively.

         K-Tron is an international company with approximately 60% of its
revenues from products manufactured and services performed from its facilities
outside the United States, primarily in Europe. As such, the financial position
and performance of the Company is sensitive to both translation and transaction
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange rates").

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues:

         Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of operations
into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly
with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark. In addition, revenues and
income of the Company with respect to particular transactions may be affected by
changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in other currencies,
including in particular the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark
and Deutsche mark/Swiss franc exchange rates. For the first quarters of 1997 and
1996, the changes in these exchange rates were as follows:

         Total revenues decreased by $2.2 million or 9.4% in the first quarter
of 1997 when compared to the same period in 1996. The decrease in revenues was
due to lower foreign exchange translation rates. Revenue would have increased by
0.1% when using constant foreign exchange rates.

         Gross margin as a percent of revenues improved to 43.9% in the first
quarter of 1997, as compared to 42.1% for the same period in 1996. The
improvement in gross margin in 1997 was due to sales mix and cost reductions.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $.6
million or 7.3% in the first quarter of 1997 as compared to the same period in
1996. The decrease in SG&A was due to lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures increased by $.1 million or
17.8% in the first quarter of 1997 as compared to the same period in 1996. R&D
increased due to the development of new product enhancements.

         Interest expense decreased by $.3 million or 47% in the first quarter
of 1997 as compared to the same period in 1996, primarily due to lower debt
levels and lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         The effective tax rates for the first quarter of 1997 and 1996 were 23%
and 38%, respectively. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 1997 was
lower than the 1996 first quarter rate due to the utilization of foreign net
operating loss carry forwards.

         The Company's backlog remained constant at the end of the first quarter
of 1997 compared to the same period in 1996 (at constant foreign exchange

         At the end of 1995, the Company's Swiss manufacturing subsidiary was in
violation of certain equity guarantees contained in its loan agreements with
several Swiss lenders, resulting in a default under each of those loan
agreements. In early 1996, a forbearance agreement was entered into with the
Swiss lenders, which was described in detail in Item 7 of the Company's annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 1995. In February
1997, this forbearance agreement, which was scheduled to expire on March 31,
1997, was amended and extended until March 31, 1999, and such subsidiary is not
in default under any of its loan agreements with such lenders.

         Total debt decreased by $3.0 million in the first three months of 1997,
of which $1.3 million was due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.
Total debt without the effect of the foreign exchange translation decreased by
$1.7 million. European and U.S. debt decreased by $1.5 million and $.2 million,
respectively. At March 29, 1997, the Company had $5.7 million of availability
under its U.S. revolving credit agreement and $5.8 million of availability under
certain of its Swiss loan agreements.

         At March 29, 1997, there was working capital of $14.8 million as
compared to $15.4 million at December 28, 1996, and the ratio of current assets
to current liabilities at those dates was 1.77 and 1.80, respectively. Working
capital decreased in 1997 primarily due to the utilization of funds generated
from operations and improved asset management to reduce indebtedness.

         For the first three months of 1997 and 1996, the Company utilized
earnings from operations and internally-generated funds to meet its working
capital needs and reduce debt.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 million in the first
three months of 1997 as compared to $1.4 million in the same period of 1996. The
increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to improved operating profits
as well as continued focus on asset management.

         Net cash used in investing activities for the first three months of
1997 and 1996 was for capital additions.

         Net cash used in financing activities for the first three months of
1997 and 1996 was for the reduction of debt and was obtained from the cash
provided from operating activities.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease in
shareholders' equity of $.5 million in the first three months of 1997.
