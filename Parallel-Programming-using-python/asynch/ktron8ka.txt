         Item 4.  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
                  ----------------------------------------------

                  On August 13, 2003, the Audit Committee of the Board of
         Directors of K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron" or the "Company"),
         pursuant to authority delegated to it by K-Tron's Board of Directors,
         dismissed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as K-Tron's independent auditors. In
         addition, on August 13, 2003, the Audit Committee engaged Grant
         Thornton LLP to serve as K-Tron's independent auditors for the fiscal
         year ending January 3, 2004. KPMG had been engaged to serve as the
         Company's independent auditors on June 22, 2002, following the
         dismissal of Arthur Andersen LLP.

                  KPMG's report on K-Tron's consolidated financial statements
         for the past year did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of
         opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
         scope or accounting principles, except as follows:

                  KPMG's report on the consolidated financial statements of
         K-Tron International, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 28,
         2002 contained a separate paragraph stating, "the fiscal 2001 and
         fiscal 2000 consolidated financial statements and financial statement
         schedule of K-Tron International, Inc. and subsidiaries were audited by
         other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 7,
         these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include
         the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial
         Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets",
         which was adopted by the Company as of December 30, 2001. In our
         opinion, such disclosures for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 in Note 7 are
         appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply
         any procedures to the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 consolidated
         financial statements and financial statement schedule of K-Tron
         International, Inc. and subsidiaries other than with respect to such
         disclosures, and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any
         other form of assurance on the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 consolidated
         financial statements taken as a whole".

                  During K-Tron's most recent fiscal year and through the date
         of KPMG's dismissal, there were no disagreements with KPMG on any
         matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
         disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to
         KPMG's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the
         subject matter in connection with its report on K-Tron's consolidated
         financial statements for such year.

                  During K-Tron's two most recent fiscal years and through the
         date of Grant Thornton LLP's engagement, K-Tron did not consult with
         Grant Thornton LLP with respect to the application of accounting
         principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or
         the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on K-Tron's
         consolidated financial statements, or any other matters.

                  K-Tron has provided KPMG with a copy of the foregoing
         disclosure. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of KPMG's letter, dated
         August 22, 2003.
