                 K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC. & SUBSIDIARIES
                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                (Unaudited)

1.   Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
     accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all
     of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
     accounting principles for complete financial statements.  The
     consolidated financial statements include the accounts of K-Tron
     International, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries.  All
     intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  In
     the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal
     recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation of
     results for interim periods have been made.  The results for the
     interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a
     full year.

     The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in
     conjunction with the Company's Annual Report or Form 10-K for the year
     ended December 31, 1994 which was previously filed with the Securities
     and Exchange Commission.

2.   Disposition of Business

     On June 23, 1995, subsidiaries of the Company sold Colortronic GmbH and
     rights to several related patents and patent applications to an investment
     group for $9 million.

     The Swiss banks have not yet allocated $5,150,000 of the proceeds to
     specific debt outstanding, but will do so in the near future.
     Accordingly, this amount has been reflected as a reduction to notes
     payable to banks in the accompanying balance sheet as of July 1, 1995.

     The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $10,529,000 on the disposition.

     The Company has generated a significant tax loss carry forward due to the
     sale of Colortronic GmbH.  In the second quarter the Company recorded a
     $1,550,000 tax benefit relating to this loss based upon the existence of
     deferred tax liabilities which no longer will be required and estimates of
     future income.  The Company has set up a valuation allowance of
     approximately half of the tax benefit associated with the sale.

ITEM 2.                 K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC.
                  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
               FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                        Six Months ended July 1, 1995

Financial Condition

     As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1994, the Company and its U.S. manufacturing
subsidiary are in default under several financial covenants contained in
their loan agreement with three U.S. banks.  These defaults are continuing
and have not been waived.  However, on April 28, 1995, the Company and its
U.S. subsidiaries entered into a forbearance agreement with the U.S. banks
in which such banks agreed to forbear in the exercise of their rights and
remedies under the loan documents.  On June 22, 1995 this agreement was
amended and extended through the earlier of February 28, 1996 or the
occurrence of a new event of default thereunder.  See subsequent discussion of
the effect of a default under Swiss loan agreements.  The forbearance agreement
also modified the existing loan documents in certain aspects, including the
granting of additional collateral.  At July 1, 1995, the principal amount
outstanding under the Company's U.S. loan agreement was $10,028,000.

     On June 23, 1995, subsidiaries of K-Tron sold Colortronic GmbH and
rights to several related patents and patent applications to an investment
group for $9 million.  The group included two K-Tron executives,
including its president and CEO.  Both subsequently resigned their K-Tron
positions, and Leo C. Beebe, K-Tron's chairman, assumed the duties of chief
executive officer.

     The pro forma results of K-Tron without Colortronic are shown below:

*Excluding the pre-tax loss on sale of Colortronic of $10,529 million.

     The Colortronic divestiture generated a pre-tax loss of $10,529
million.  This loss was primarily a non-cash write-off of goodwill.

                                    -6-

<PAGE>   9

The tax loss carryforward generated by the sale can be used to offset future
cash tax payments.  As a result of the sale of Colortronic GmbH, K-Tron's debt 
decreased by $24.2 million.

     The loss on the sale of Colortronic caused K-Tron's Swiss subsidiary's
equity to fall below the equity guarantees in its loan agreements with
Swiss banks.  As a result, the subsidiary is in default and these loans
have been reclassified as short-term.

     The subsidiary is currently negotiating a revised financing agreement
with the Swiss banks, but there can be no assurance that a new agreement
will be entered into or that the Swiss banks will not demand payment of
their loans.  Furthermore, such equity violation is a new event of default
under the Company's U.S. loan agreement described above.  At July 1, 1995,
the principal amount outstanding under the Swiss loan agreements was $32.2
million.

     The Company is seeking alternative debt or equity financing.  At this
time, the Company has not obtained commitments, and its ability to continue
as a going concern depends on the future availability of its existing
credit facilities or replacement lines of credit, or the raising of cash
through the sale of assets or additional equity.  If the Company is
unsuccessful in these efforts, it may be unable to meet its obligations in
a timely manner, making it necessary to undertake such other actions as may
be appropriate to preserve asset values.

Results of Operations

     K-Tron is an international company with two-thirds of its business
arising from sources outside the United States, primarily Europe.  As such,
the financial position and performance of the Company is sensitive to both
translation and transaction fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.

     In the second quarter of 1995, the Company reported a net loss of
$8.950 million after recording an after-tax loss of $8.979 million on the
sale of Colortronic as noted above.  Profit margins were negatively
affected by heavily discounted orders booked in 1994 or quoted prior to
recent price increases and the inability to pass on increased material
costs caused by the appreciation of the Swiss franc to customers in certain
European countries.   If the Colortronic business had not been a part of
K-Tron's operations for the quarter, then the Company would have reported
second quarter 1995 pre-tax income from operations of $439,000.

    Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of
operations into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange
rates, particularly with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark.
Revenues and earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 1995
were affected by changes in the average U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and average
U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark exchange rates, as follows:

    Total revenues for the second quarter of 1995 increased by $8.2
million or 33% ($4.2 million or 17% when using constant foreign exchange
rates) and $16.6 million or 36% for the first six months of 1995 ($9.7
million or 20% when using constant foreign exchange rates) versus the same
periods in 1994.  Total revenues increased due to the strong European and

                                    -8-
<PAGE>   11

United States year end 1994 backlog, strong 1995 new order inflow and the
effect of a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc and Deutsche
mark.

    Gross margin as a percent of revenues declined to 36.6% in the second
quarter of 1995 and 36.7% for the first six months of 1995 as compared to
40.3% and 40.5% respectively for the same periods in 1994.  The decline in
the 1995 margin was primarily due to heavily discounted orders booked in
1994, as well as the inability to pass on increased material costs caused
by the appreciation of the Swiss franc to customers in certain European
countries.

    Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased by $1.9
million, or 23.8% in the second quarter of 1995 and $4.4 million or 28.7%
for the first six months of 1995 as compared to the same periods in 1994.
The increase was primarily due to higher foreign exchange translation rates
as well as to higher commissions and selling expenses related to the
increased sales volume.  In addition, the Company incurred costs related to
the forbearance agreement and costs related to the Company's efforts to
arrange new financing or sell assets.  As a percent of revenues, SG&A was
29.4% in the second quarter of 1995 and 31.4% for the first six months of
1995 as compared to 31.6% and 33.1% respectively for the same periods in
1994.  The decrease in SG&A as a percent of revenues in 1995 was primarily
due to the increase in revenues.

    Research and development (R&D) expenditures in the second quarter and
first six months of 1995 decreased $.1 million as compared to the same
periods in 1994 due to synergies realized from the integration of the
Company's brands and the completion of several major programs, offset in
part by the higher foreign exchange translation rate.  R&D expense as a
percent of revenues was 3.0% in second quarter 1995 and 3.1% for the first
six months of 1995 as compared to 4.3% and 4.5% respectively in 1994.  The
decrease in R&D as a percent of revenues in 1995 was primarily due to the
increase in revenues.

    Interest expense increased over prior periods as a result of increased debt
levels in Europe and higher effective interest rates in the United States.

    The Company has generated a significant tax loss carry forward due to the
sale of Colortronic GmbH.  In the second quarter the Company recorded a
$1,550,000 tax benefit relating to this loss based upon the existence of
deferred tax liabilities which no longer will be required and estimates of
future income.  The Company has set up a valuation allowance of approximately
half of the tax benefit associated with the sale.

    The backlog of orders excluding Colortronic GmbH increased at the end of
the second quarter of 1995 by 24% as compared to the same period in 1994 (using
July 1, 1995 foreign exchange translation rates for both calculations),
primarily due to the European recovery from recession and continued good
bookings in the United States.

    Increased selling prices and reduced production and distribution costs
should improve future margins, and the Company's objective continues to be
to return to profitability from operations later in 1995.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

quarters of 1995 and fiscal year 1994 is set forth below:

</TABLE>

    Total debt decreased since year end 1994 by $16.8 million despite a
$6.0 million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.
Total debt without the effect of the foreign exchange translation decreased
by $22.8 million.  The debt reduction associated with the sale of Colortronic
was $24.2 million.  The Company had available $.5 million in additional
borrowing facilities as of July 1, 1995.

    At the end of the second quarter and first quarter of 1995, working
capital was ($16.9 million) and ($.3 million), respectively, and the ratio
of current assets to current liabilities was .74 and .99,

                                   -10-

<PAGE>   13

respectively.  As explained earlier, this change in working capital was
heavily affected by reclassifying $24.2 million from long term to short
term debt.

    Cash used in the first six months operating activities was $.1
million. In the second quarter of 1995, $.8 million of cash was provided
from operations primarily from improved asset management.

    Cash provided from investing activities for the first six months of
1995 was due to the funds received from the sale of Colortronic GmbH.

    Cash used in finance activities for the first six months of 1995 was
primarily the result of using the proceeds from the sale of Colortronic
GmbH to reduce bank debt.

    Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease (after
the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment associated with the
Colortronic sale) in shareholders' equity of $213,000 in the first six months 
of 1995.

Item 3.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities

    As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1994, the Company and its U.S. manufacturing subsidiary
are in default under several financial covenants contained in their loan
agreement with three U.S. banks.  These defaults are continuing and have not
been waived.  However, on April 28, 1995, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries
entered into a forbearance agreement with the U.S. banks in which such banks
agreed to forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the loan
documents.  On June 22, 1995 this agreement was amended and extended through
the earlier of February 28, 1996 or the occurrence of a new event of default
thereunder.  The forbearance agreement also modified the existing loan
documents in certain aspects, including the granting of additional collateral. 
At July 1, 1995, the principal amount outstanding under the Company's U.S.
loan agreement was $10,028,000.

    The loss on the sale of Colortronic caused K-Tron's Swiss subsidiary's
equity to fall below the equity guarantees in its loan agreements with
Swiss banks.  As a result, the subsidiary is in default and these loans
have been reclassified as short-term.

    The subsidiary is currently negotiating a revised financing agreement
with the Swiss banks, but there can be no assurance that a new agreement
will be entered into or that the Swiss banks will not demand payment of
their loans.  Furthermore, such equity violation is a new event of default
under the Company's U.S. loan agreement described above.  At July 1, 1995,
the principal amount outstanding under the Swiss loan agreements was $32.2
million.
