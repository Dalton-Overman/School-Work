<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;29, 2006, K-Tron International, Inc. (&#147;K-Tron&#148;) entered into a Loan Agreement
(the &#147;New Loan Agreement&#148;) among K-Tron and certain subsidiaries of K-Tron identified therein as
borrowers (the &#147;Borrowers&#148;) and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania (&#147;Citizens&#148;), as lender and agent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
New Loan Agreement provides the Borrowers with a $50.0&nbsp;million revolving line of credit (the
&#147;Revolving Credit Facility&#148;), of which up to an aggregate
of $10.0&nbsp;million may be used for letters of credit. The Borrowers entered
into the New Loan Agreement to (i)&nbsp;refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Borrowers to
National City Bank and The Bank, (ii)&nbsp;provide for future working capital requirements and for other
general corporate purposes and (iii)&nbsp;fund permitted acquisitions, including the acquisition of
Premier Pneumatics, Inc., a Kansas corporation, described in Item&nbsp;2.01 below. On September&nbsp;29,
2006, the Borrowers borrowed $9.8&nbsp;million under the Revolving Credit Facility to pay off the terminated
credit facilities described in Section&nbsp;1.02 below and to pay
certain fees in connection with the New Loan Agreement. The New Loan
Agreement terminates on September&nbsp;29, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolving loans under the New Loan Agreement can be either prime rate loans or LIBOR rate
loans. Prime rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate of
interest announced by Citizens from time to time less a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 0.25%
depending on the level of the ratio of funded debt to adjusted earnings before interest expense,
tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses for such period (the &#147;Debt Ratio&#148;). LIBOR
rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to
LIBOR for the relevant period plus a percentage ranging
from 0.875% to 1.625%, depending on the level of the Debt Ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrowers are obligated to pay a fee for any unused borrowings with respect to the
Revolving Credit Facility equal to (i)&nbsp;a percentage ranging from 0.125% to 0.20%, depending on the
level of the Debt Ratio, times (ii)&nbsp;the average unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
In addition, the Borrowers paid Citizens a fee equal to $62,500 on execution of the New Loan
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Loan Agreement is unsecured, except that the lenders have been given a pledge of 65%
of the equity interests of the following foreign subsidiaries of the Company: K-Tron (Schweiz) AG, K-Tron
Colormax Limited and K-Tron PCS Limited. The New Loan Agreement contains financial and other
covenants, such as maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio, net worth and Debt Ratio
requirements, and includes limitations on, among other things, liens,
certain acquisitions, consolidations,
sales of assets, incurrence of debt and capital expenditures. If an event of default, such as
non-payment or failure to observe specific covenants, were to occur under the New Loan Agreement,
the lenders would be entitled to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility immediately due
and payable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Loan Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with entering into the New Loan Agreement, on September&nbsp;29, 2006 K-Tron
terminated several existing credit facilities and repaid any and all outstanding amounts under such
credit facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first credit facility that was terminated was entered into on January&nbsp;3, 2003 to partially
finance the acquisition by the Company of all of the stock of Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation
(&#147;Penn Crusher&#148;). In connection with that acquisition, Penn
Crusher borrowed $15.0&nbsp;million from National City Bank consisting
of $13.5&nbsp;million in secured term debt ($10.0&nbsp;million with a five-year term and $3.5&nbsp;million with a
six-year term (collectively, the &#147;Term Debt&#148;)) and $1.5&nbsp;million under a five-year secured revolving
credit facility (together with the Term Debt, the &#147;National City Debt&#148;). Subject to certain
conditions, the revolving credit facility provided for up to $3.5&nbsp;million of total availability,
including the $1.5&nbsp;million originally borrowed thereunder. As of
September&nbsp;29, 2006, the only debt still outstanding to National
City Bank was $3,062,500 on the five-year term loan. K-Tron paid $3,063,145 to terminate the
National City Debt (including principal, accrued interest, accrued
fees and breakage costs), and National City released all security interests it held in
connection therewith.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the credit agreement dated January&nbsp;3, 2003 (the &#147;Prior Loan Agreement&#148;) among Penn
Crusher, the lenders party to that credit agreement and National City
Bank, as agent, was previously
filed as an exhibit to K-Tron&#146;s Form 8-K dated January&nbsp;2, 2003 and filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on January&nbsp;15, 2003. A copy of amendment no. 1 dated May&nbsp;12, 2003 to the Prior
Loan Agreement was previously filed as an exhibit to K-Tron&#146;s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended June&nbsp;28, 2003. A copy of amendment no. 2 dated as of June&nbsp;28, 2005 to the Prior Loan
Agreement was previously filed as an exhibit to K-Tron&#146;s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
July&nbsp;2, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second credit facility that was terminated was entered into on December&nbsp;20, 2002 to
partially finance the acquisition of Penn Crusher. K-Tron, through K-Tron America, Inc. (&#147;K-Tron
America&#148;), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of K-Tron, borrowed $5.0&nbsp;million from The Bank, a
subsidiary of Fulton Financial Corporation, which loan was combined with an outstanding term loan
from The Bank to K-Tron America and resulted in a new $7.3&nbsp;million term loan. This loan was secured
by substantially all of the assets of K-Tron America and was guaranteed by K-Tron. As of September
29, 2006, there was $3,666,667 outstanding under this term loan, and K-Tron paid
$3,694,207 to terminate that obligation (including principal, accrued
interest, accrued fees and a prepayment fee). A copy of the note dated December&nbsp;20, 2002 from K-Tron America, Inc. in favor of
The Bank was previously filed as an exhibit to K-Tron&#146;s Form 8-K dated January&nbsp;2, 2003 and filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January&nbsp;15, 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third credit facility that was terminated was entered into in June&nbsp;2004 to finance the
prepayment of $4,000,000 of unsecured promissory notes issued by
K-Tron to the
former stockholders of Penn Crusher as consideration in the acquisition
of that company. K-Tron borrowed $4,000,000 from The Bank, a subsidiary of Fulton Financial
Corporation. This term loan was guaranteed by the K-Tron America. As of
September&nbsp;29, 2006, $2,950,000 was outstanding under this term
loan, and K-Tron paid

Premier Stock was made by Premier Pneumatics, Inc., a Delaware

agent in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement, dated as of October 5, 2006, entered

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     This Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into on
the 4th day of October, 2006 by and among Robert B. Korbelik, individually ("Mr.
Korbelik"), The Robert B. Korbelik Trust dated December 14, 1995, as amended and
restated July 20, 2000, Robert B. Korbelik and Debra A. Korbelik, trustees (the

owner of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Premier Pneumatics,
Inc., a Kansas corporation (the "Company"), and Premier Pneumatics, Inc., a

the Company (the "Shares"). The Buyer desires to purchase from the Seller's
Trust, the Seller's Trust desires to sell to the Buyer and Mr. Korbelik desires

follows:

     (a) cash in the amount of $25,564,670 shall be paid by the Buyer to the

     (b) cash in the amount of $2,000,000 shall be deposited by the Buyer with
the escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") designated in the escrow agreement (the
"Escrow Agreement") in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto to be entered
into at the Closing among the Buyer, the Sellers and the Escrow Agent, and shall
be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow

Closing shall be deemed effective for accounting and tax purposes as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time").

     (b) At the Closing, the Seller's Trust shall deliver to the Buyer, free and
clear of all pledges, liens, transfer and stamp tax obligations, encumbrances,
claims and other charges thereon of every kind, the certificates for the Shares

powers attached thereto and signed in blank, in exchange for the delivery by the
Buyer (i) to the Seller's Trust, the consideration to be paid to the Seller's
Trust pursuant to Section 1(a) hereof and (ii) to the Escrow Agent, the amount
to be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to Section

of all of the assets and properties of every kind and nature, tangible and
intangible, of the Company and of all other things and matters pertaining to the

<PAGE>

     $64,670, the Purchase Price would be decreased by $100,000), and (B) if the
     amount of the Net Working Capital at Closing on the finally determined
     Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Closing Net Working Capital
     Target, a dollar for dollar increase to the Purchase Price by the amount of

     (b) As soon as reasonably practicable following (but not more than 60 days

deliver to the Seller's Trust, a written statement (the "Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement") setting forth the Closing Balance Sheet and the Buyer's

     (c) Within 30 days after its receipt of the Final Purchase Price

its agreement or disagreement with the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement and the accuracy of any of the Buyer's Proposed Calculations (and
during such 30 day period, the Buyer shall grant the Seller's Trust and its
accountants reasonable access to all work papers, schedules and calculations
used in the preparation of the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement). If
the Seller's Trust disputes any aspect of the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement or the amount of any of the Buyer's Proposed Calculations within such
30 day period, then the Seller's Trust shall have the right to direct its
independent accountants, at the expense of the Seller's Trust, to review and
verify the accuracy of the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement, and if
the Seller's Trust does not dispute any aspect of the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement or the amount of any of the Buyer's Proposed Calculations
within such 30-day period, then the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement
and the Buyer's Proposed Calculations shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Buyer and the Sellers. In the event of a dispute, the Seller's Trust and its
accountants shall complete their review and verification of the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement within 30 days after the Seller's Trust's receipt
thereof and, if the Seller's Trust and its accountants, after such review and
verification, still disagree with the Buyer's Proposed Calculations, the
Seller's Trust shall submit its proposed alternative calculations (the "Seller's
Proposed Calculations") of the amount of Net Working Capital at Closing, and the

writing within 45 days after the Seller's Trust's receipt of the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement. If the Buyer does not accept the Seller's Proposed
Calculations within 15 days after the Buyer's receipt thereof, then, within 15
days after the date of the Buyer's rejection of (or failure to timely accept)
the Seller's Proposed Calculations, the Seller's Trust and the Buyer shall
select a mutually acceptable and nationally recognized independent accounting
firm (such firm, the "Independent Accounting Firm") to resolve the remaining
disputed items (the "Remaining Disputed Items") by conducting the Independent
Accounting Firm's own review and verification of the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement, and thereafter selecting either the Seller's Proposed
Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or the Buyer's Proposed
Calculations of the Remaining Disputed Items or an amount in between the two.
The Seller's Trust and the Buyer shall be bound by the determination of the
Remaining Disputed Items by the Independent Accounting Firm. The parties
acknowledge that Ernst & Young LLP is a mutually acceptable firm to be
designated as the Independent Accounting Firm. Each of the Buyer and the
Seller's Trust agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Accounting
Firm, an engagement letter containing reasonable and customary terms. The Buyer
and the Seller's Trust shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
under this Section 2.2(c). The costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be borne one-half by the Buyer and one-half by the Seller's Trust.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based
upon the provisions of this Section 2.2(c), only the Remaining Disputed Items
and, in any event, each Remaining Disputed Item shall be no less than the lesser
of the amount claimed by either the Buyer or the Seller's Trust, and shall be no
greater than the greater of the amount claimed by either the Buyer or the
Seller's Trust.

     (d) Upon the final determination, in accordance with Section 2.2(c), of the
Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement and the final calculations of the
amounts of the Net Working Capital at Closing and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment calculated by reference thereto, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
as follows:

          (i) If the Net Working Capital at Closing is greater than the Closing
     Net Working Capital Target, then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller's Trust
     the Net Working Capital Adjustment (being the amount equal to any such
     excess); and

          (ii) If the Net Working Capital at Closing is less than the Closing
     Net Working Capital Target, then the Sellers shall pay to or as directed by
     the Buyer the Net Working Capital Adjustment (being an amount equal to any
     such deficiency).

          (iii) Any payments made by the Buyer to the Seller's Trust, or by the
     Sellers to or as directed by the Buyer, pursuant to this Section 2.2(d)
     shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than
     three Business Days after the final determination referred to in the first
     sentence of this Section 2.2(d) and shall be deemed to be adjustments to
     the Purchase Price for all purposes.

     3. Representations and Warranties of the Sellers. Each Seller, jointly and
severally, represents and warrants to the Buyer as follows:

     3.1 Share Ownership; Authority. The Seller's Trust is the lawful owner of

     3.2 Validity of Contemplated Transactions; Etc. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Sellers will not contravene or violate (a)
any law, rule or regulation to which either Seller is subject or (b) any
judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court, arbitrator or
governmental or regulatory official, body or authority which is applicable to
either Seller; nor will such execution, delivery or performance violate, be in
conflict with or result in the breach (with or without the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both) of any term, condition or provision of, or require the
consent of any other party to (except for such consents as have been already
been obtained, all of which are listed on Schedule 3.2), any contract,
commitment, agreement, lease, license, permit, authorization, document or other
understanding, oral or written, to or by which either Seller is a party or
otherwise bound or affected. No authorization, approval or consent of, and no

unsecured, against the Company for any reason, other than claims in the ordinary
course, consistent with past practice, for the payment of salary, 401k
contributions, expense reimbursements or payments arising from other employee
benefit plans to the extent accrued but not yet paid (all of which shall be

affect adversely such relations.

     3.21 Benefit Plans and Arrangements. (a) Schedule 3.21 hereto lists all
employee benefit plans (within the meaning of section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and all other
funds, policies, arrangements, practices, customs and understandings or programs
relating to one or more employees of the Company or a Benefits Affiliate (as
defined in this Section 3.21), whether or not they are or are intended to be (i)
covered or qualified under the Code, ERISA or any other applicable law, (ii)
written or oral, (iii) funded or unfunded or (iv) generally available to any or
all employees (or former employees) of the Company or one or more of its
Benefits Affiliates (or their beneficiaries or dependents), which were or are
established, contributed to or maintained by the Company or one or more of its
Benefits Affiliates, including without limitation welfare, fringe benefit,
pension, profit sharing, retirement, stock purchase, stock option, phantom
stock, stock bonus, disability or wage continuation, sick pay or vacation pay,
supplemental unemployment, severance or deferred compensation plans (the
"Plans"). For purposes of this Section 3.21 only, the term "Benefits Affiliate"
shall include (i) any corporation which is a member of a controlled group of
corporations (as defined in section 414(b) of the Code) which includes the
Company, (ii) any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under
common control (as defined in section 414(c) of the Code) with the Company,
(iii) any organization (whether or not incorporated) which is a member of an
affiliated service group (as defined in section 414(m) of the Code) which
includes the Company and (iv) any other entity required to be aggregated with
the Company pursuant to the regulations issued under section 414(o) of the Code.

     (b) The Sellers have delivered or made available to the Buyer true, correct
and complete copies of (i) all documents governing the Plans, and all amendments
thereto, (ii) all reports filed, with respect to any portion of the period
beginning on January 1, 2001 and ending on the Closing Date, by the Company, a
Benefits Affiliate or a Plan official with the United States Department of
Labor, the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any other federal or state
regulatory agency with respect to a Plan, (iii) all summary plan descriptions,
notices and other reporting and disclosure material furnished to participants in
any of the Plans, (iv) all actuarial, accounting and financial reports, if any,
prepared with respect to any of the Plans and (v) all currently effective IRS
ruling or determination letters on any of the Plans.

     (c) The Plans and provisions thereof, any trusts created thereby and the
operation of the Plans are (and at all times have been) in compliance with and
conform (and at all times have been in compliance with and conformed) in all
material respects to the applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA and all other
applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations.

     (d) The Plans marked on Schedule 3.21(d) hereto as "Qualified Plans" are
the only Plans that are intended to meet the requirements of section 401(a) of
the Code (a "Qualified Plan"). The Company and its Benefits Affiliates have
never maintained or contributed to any other Qualified Plan. Each of the
Qualified Plans has been determined by the IRS to be qualified under section
401(a) of the Code and


                                       14

<PAGE>

exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, and each such determination
remains in effect and has not been revoked. Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.21(d), nothing has occurred with respect to the design or operation of any
Qualified Plan that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or
the imposition of any liability, lien, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code,
and the Qualified Plans have been timely amended to comply with current law and
regulations to the extent such amendments are required by law at the time of
Closing.

     (e) With respect to each Plan, there has occurred no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of section 4975 of the Code or section 406 of
ERISA) or breach of any fiduciary duty described in section 404 of ERISA that
could result in any material liability, direct or indirect, for the Company or a
Benefits Affiliate or any stockholder, officer, director or employee of the
Company or a Benefits Affiliate. The Company and its Benefits Affiliates have
paid all amounts that the Company and its Benefits Affiliates are required to
pay as contributions to the Plans as of the last day of the most recent fiscal
year of each of the Plans; all benefits accrued under any funded or unfunded
Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise adequately reserved in accordance with
GAAP; and all monies withheld from employee paychecks with respect to Plans have
been transferred to the appropriate Plan in a timely manner as required by
applicable law. No Plan provides for the investment in stock of the Company or a
Benefits Affiliate.

     (f) The Company and its Benefits Affiliates have not incurred any liability
for any excise, income or other taxes or penalties with respect to any Plan, and
no event has occurred and no circumstance exists or has existed that could give
rise to any such liability. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims by or on behalf of any Plans, or by or on behalf of
any participants in or beneficiaries of any Plans or other persons, alleging any
breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Company or any Benefits Affiliate or
any of their officers, directors or employees under ERISA or any applicable law,
or claiming benefit payments other than those made in the ordinary operation of
such plans, nor is there any basis for any such claim. No Plan is presently
under audit or examination (nor has notice been received of a potential audit or
examination) by the IRS, the Department of Labor or any other governmental
entity, and no matters are pending with respect to any Plan under any IRS
program.

     (g) No Plan contains any provision or is subject to any law that would
prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that would give rise
to any vesting of benefits, severance, termination, or other payments or
liabilities as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
no payments or benefits under any Plan or other agreement of the Company or its
Benefits Affiliates will be considered "excess parachute payments" under section
280G of the Code. No Plan triggers the imposition of penalty taxes under section
409A of the Code. Each Plan that is subject to section 409A of the Code has been
maintained and operated in good faith based on IRS guidance with respect to
section 409A of the Code and has been amended to comply with section 409A of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Benefits Affiliate has declared or paid any
bonus compensation in contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

     (h) Neither the Company nor any Benefits Affiliate has made any plan or
commitment, whether or not legally binding, to create any additional Plan or to
modify or change any existing Plan. No statement, either written or oral, has
been made by the Company or its Benefits Affiliates to any person with regard to
any Plan that was not in accordance with the Plan and that could have an adverse
economic consequence to the Company or its Benefits Affiliates. All Plans may be
amended or terminated without penalty by the Company or its Benefits Affiliates
at any time on or after the Closing.

     (i) All persons classified by the Company or its Benefits Affiliates as
independent contractors satisfy and have at all times satisfied the requirements
of applicable law to be so classified; the Company and its Benefits Affiliates
have fully and accurately reported their compensation on IRS Forms 1099 when
required to do so; and the Company and its Benefits Affiliates have no
obligations to provide


                                       15

<PAGE>

benefits with respect to such persons under Plans or otherwise. No individuals
are currently providing, or have ever provided, services to the Company or its
Benefits Affiliates pursuant to a leasing agreement or similar type of
arrangement, nor has the Company or its Benefits Affiliates entered into any
arrangement whereby such services will be provided.

     (j) No Plan is, and neither the Company nor any Benefits Affiliate has any
liability, actual or contingent, with respect to any Plan that is (i) a defined
benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer pension
plan, as that term is defined in sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37) of ERISA, (iii) a
plan providing life, health or medical benefits to retired or terminated
employees (other than as required by sections 601-608 of ERISA) or (iv) a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in section 3(40) of ERISA.

     (k) With respect to any Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan
(within the meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA) (a "Welfare Plan"), (i) each
Welfare Plan for which contributions are claimed as deductions under any
provision of the Code is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable requirements pertaining to such deductions and (ii) any Plan that is
a group health plan (within the meaning of section 5000(b)(1) of the Code)
materially complies, and in each and every case has in all material respects
complied, with all applicable requirements of ERISA and section 4980B of the
Code.

warranties in Section 3.15 hereof and not in limitation thereof, and except as

otherwise used by the Company, or to give rise to any legal liability of the
Company under the Environmental Laws pertaining to any property now or at any
prior time owned, operated, leased or otherwise used by the Company or any of
its predecessors, (e) neither the Company nor either Seller has received a
request under any of the Environmental Laws for information relating to any
property now or at any prior time owned, operated, leased or otherwise used by

have in the past been listed on the National Priorities List of sites under the

any comparable state or local environmental database, (h) there are no pending,
and there have not been in the past, Environmental Claims relating to any

to the knowledge of the Company, there is no asbestos-containing material,

with respect to the cleanup or investigation at any facility or property at

     4.4 No Brokers or Finders. All negotiations by the Buyer relative to this
Agreement have been carried on by the Buyer or its affiliates directly without
the intervention of any person who may be entitled to any brokerage or finder's
fee or other commission or compensation in respect hereof or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5. Covenants.

     5.1 Non-Competition. The Buyer and Mr. Korbelik hereby agree that the
covenants set forth in this Section 5.1 are a material and substantial part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (a) Prohibited Activities. Until three years after the Closing Date, Mr.
Korbelik agrees that he will not, anywhere in the United States, Canada or
Mexico (the "Territory"), unless in accordance with the Buyer's prior written
consent:

          (i) (directly or indirectly) own, manage, operate, join, control,
     finance or participate in the ownership, management, operation, control or
     financing of, or be connected as an officer, director, employee, principal,
     agent, representative, consultant, investor, owner, partner, manager, joint
     venturer or otherwise with, or permit his name to be used by or in
     connection with, any business or enterprise engaged anywhere in the
     Territory in any of the businesses engaged in by the Company on the Closing
     Date;

          (ii) call on or solicit any person who or which is, at that time, or
     has been within two years prior thereto, a customer of the Company with
     respect to any business covered by clause (i) above; or


                                       20

<PAGE>

          (iii) solicit the employment of or hire any person who at the time of
     such solicitation or hiring or who within one year prior thereto, is or was
     employed by the Company on a full or part-time basis.

Notwithstanding the above, the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed to
prohibit Mr. Korbelik from acquiring as a passive investment not more than one
percent of the outstanding voting capital stock of a competing business, whose
stock is traded on a national securities exchange or through the automated
quotation system of a registered securities association.

     (b) Remedies. Mr. Korbelik acknowledges that (i) the business of the
Company is conducted throughout the Territory and the provisions of this Section
5.1 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
Buyer as the purchaser of the Shares, (ii) any violation of this Section 5.1
will result in irreparable injury to the Buyer and the Company, and that damages
at law would not be reasonable or adequate compensation to the Buyer and the
Company and (iii) the Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to have the
provisions of this Section 5.1 specifically enforced by preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages and
without posting bond or other security as well as to an equitable accounting of
all earnings, profits and other benefits arising out of any violation of this
Section 5.1, including without limitation, estimated future earnings. In the
event that the provisions of this Section 5.1 should ever be deemed to exceed
the time, geographic, product or any other limitations permitted by applicable
law, then such provisions shall be deemed reformed to the maximum permitted by
applicable law.

     (c) Jurisdiction. The Buyer and Mr. Korbelik intend to and do hereby confer
jurisdiction to enforce the covenants set forth in this Section 5.1 upon the
courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants. In
addition to Section 9.14 hereof and not in limitation thereof, if the courts of
any one or more of such jurisdictions hold such covenants unenforceable in whole
or in part, it is the intention of the Buyer and each of the Sellers that such
determination not bar or in any way adversely affect the right of the Buyer and
the Company to equitable relief and remedies hereunder in courts of any other
jurisdiction as to breaches or violations of this Section 5.1, such covenants
being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent covenants.

     5.2 Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between the Buyer and the Sellers for certain tax matters
following the Closing Date:

     (a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are
filed after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall permit the Sellers to review and
comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to
filing. The Sellers shall be solely responsible for Taxes of the Company with
respect to such periods, and shall reimburse the Buyer therefor within 15 days
after payment by the Buyer or the Company, but only if and to the extent such
Taxes are not reflected in the accrual for Tax liability (rather than any
accrual for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) shown on the face of the finally determined Closing Balance
Sheet.

     (b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any
Tax Returns of the Company for tax periods which begin before the Closing Date
and end after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall pay to the Buyer within 15
days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such
taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are not
reflected in the accrual for Tax liability (rather than any accrual for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
shown on the finally determined Closing Balance Sheet. For purposes of this
Section 5.2, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the


                                       21

<PAGE>

Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such
taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Company.

     (c) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 5.2 and in
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon
request of the other party, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any governmental authority or any other person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including without limitation with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby). All Tax deductions relating to the payment of all amounts payable under
the Phantom Stock Plans and any employee bonus or other compensation plan
(collectively, the "Bonus Plans") to the extent accrued on the finally
determined Closing Balance Sheet shall be reflected on the Form 1120S for the
period ending on the Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
Bonus Plans that are payable as a result of the Closing shall be treated as
accrued immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Closing Date, each
Tax Return prepared or caused to be prepared by the Buyer with respect to the
Company that relates to any period that includes days on or before the Closing
Date shall be subject to pre-filing review by the Sellers. Unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties, Tax Returns subject to such pre-filing review shall be
submitted by the Buyer to the Sellers at least 15 days prior to the due date of
such return, and the Sellers shall complete their review of such return and
provide comments, if any, within 15 days of receipt. In the event of any
disagreement relating to any such return between the Buyer and the Sellers, such
disagreement shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and any such
determination by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, save for fraud
or manifest error.

     (d) Company S Election. With respect to any period ended on or prior to the
Closing Date, the Buyer and the Sellers shall not revoke (or allow to be
revoked) the Company's election to be taxed as an S corporation within the
meaning of sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code and any corresponding provisions
of state law. The Buyer and the Sellers shall not take or allow any action,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that would result in
the termination of the Company's status as a validly electing S corporation
within the meaning of sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code and any corresponding
provisions of state law.

     (e) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

          (i) The Seller's Trust shall join with the Buyer in making an election
     under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under
     state, local or foreign tax law) (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
     Election") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares; provided
     that, as a condition to the Seller's Trust making the Section 338(h)(10)
     Election, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller's Trust, in cash, the amount of
     additional consideration necessary to cause the Sellers' after-tax net
     proceeds from the sale of the Shares with the Section 338(h)(10) Election
     to be equal to the after-tax net proceeds that the Sellers would have
     received had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been made, taking into
     account all appropriate federal, state and local tax considerations (the
     "Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up"), in accordance with the payment and
     adjustment procedures set forth in Section 5.2(e)(iv) hereof. An
     illustration of a calculation of the Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up based on
     an good faith estimate of the ADSP of the assets of the Company and the tax
     basis of the Company's assets as of the Closing Date is set


                                       22

<PAGE>

     forth in Schedule 5.2(e)(i). After final determination of the ADSP of the
     Company's assets pursuant to Section 5.2(e)(iii), the final calculation of
     the Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up shall be made as set forth in Section
     5.2(e)(iv). In determining the Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up, the Buyer and
     the Sellers shall take into account Mr. Korbelik's status as a resident of
     Colorado and the calculation must assume that long-term capital gain
     treatment would have been afforded to the Sellers for the sale of the
     Shares to Buyer in the absence of the Section 338(h)(10) Election being
     made.

          (ii) At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller's Trust for
     execution a Form 8023 and any similar form under state or local law, and
     any schedules or attachments thereto (collectively, the "Section 338
     Forms"). Within ten days of receipt of the Section 338 Forms, the Seller's
     Trust shall duly and promptly execute such Section 338 Forms and shall
     deliver them to the Buyer. The Buyer shall timely file such executed
     Section 338 Forms and shall deliver copies of them to the Seller's Trust.
     The Seller's Trust and the Buyer shall file all Tax Returns (including
     amended returns and claims for refund) in a manner consistent with such
     Section 338 Forms.

          (iii) The Buyer and the Seller's Trust shall cooperate as provided
     herein to determine the "aggregate deemed sales price" in accordance with
     Treasury Regulations section 1.338-4 ("ADSP") and the allocation of the
     ADSP among the assets of the Company in accordance with Treasury
     Regulations sections 1.338-6 and 1.338-7. Within 10 days after the final
     determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer shall initially
     determine and send written notice to the Seller's Trust of the ADSP and its
     allocation to the assets of the Company. The Seller's Trust will be deemed
     to have accepted the Buyer's calculation of the ADSP and its allocation
     unless it provides written notice of disagreement to the Buyer within 20
     days after receipt of such calculation and allocation. If the Seller's
     Trust provides such notice to the Buyer, the parties shall attempt in good
     faith to agree to any disputed items. If, within 20 days after the Buyer
     receives the Seller's Trust's notice of disagreement, the parties have not
     reached agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be engaged to
     determine any items remaining in dispute. The Sellers and the Buyer shall
     each pay one-half of the fees of the Independent Accounting Firm relating
     to such dispute. Buyer, the Company, and Sellers shall prepare and file
     Internal Revenue Service Form 8883, and all Tax Returns (including amended
     returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner
     consistent with the allocations determined pursuant to this Section
     5.2(e)(iii).

          (iv) Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up.

                    (1) Within 20 days of the final determination of the ADSP
and its allocation in accordance with Section 5.2(e)(iii), the Seller's Trust
shall provide the Buyer a written calculation of the Section 338(h)(10) Gross
Up, such calculation to be based on a materially accurate calculation of the
Company's tax basis in its assets on the Closing Date. The Buyer will be deemed
to have accepted such calculation unless it provides the Seller's Trust written
notice of disagreement within 20 days of receipt of the Seller's Trust's
calculation. If the Buyer provides written notice of disagreement, any items of
disagreement shall be resolved in a manner similar to that provided in Section
5.2(e)(iii).

                    (2) The Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up shall be paid by Buyer
by wire transfer to the Seller's Trust after the final calculation of the of the
Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up pursuant to Section 5.2(e)(iv) and at least 15 days
prior to the due date of the federal estimated tax payment of the Sellers that
encompasses the Closing.

                    (3) The Sellers shall refund the portion of the Section
338(h)(10) Gross Up that is excessive based on a breach of the representation
made in Section 3.13(o). The Sellers shall


                                       23

<PAGE>

refund the entire Section 338(h)(10) Gross Up in the event the Section
338(h)(10) Election is deemed invalid by a final determination of the applicable
taxing or governmental authority.

     5.3 Benefit Plans. The Buyer shall cause the Company to pay to the
Company's employees' 401(k) accounts at least the amounts accrued as of the
Closing Date under the Company's 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan in a manner
consistent with the Company's past practices. In addition, not later than
January 31, 2007, the Buyer shall cause the Company to pay at least the amounts
accrued as of the Closing Date under the Company's Management Incentive
Compensation Plan in the amounts and to each of the individuals set forth on
Schedule 5.3 (the "Management Bonus Payments"). The Management Bonus Payments
shall be deemed fully vested as of the Closing Date and shall be paid to the
applicable employee (or any such employee's estate, if applicable) regardless of
whether any such employee remains employed as of the payment date.

provision) be liable to any or all Buyer Indemnified Parties under such Sections
exceeds in the aggregate $300,000 (the "Deductible") or (b) for an amount in
excess of $4,250,000 provided, however, that the Deductible will also apply to
any liability to any Buyer Indemnified Party relating to a breach of Section
3.13, or any other Section, to the extent such breach relates to any state
income, sales, franchise or other similar state Tax.

     8.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. Except as provided in

relating to Taxes and Tax Returns (as defined in Section 3.13 hereof) shall
survive the Closing for the period of the applicable statutes of limitation plus
any extensions or waivers thereof, (b) all representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7(c), 3.7(d), 3.25, 4.3 and 4.4

settled. Except as set forth in Section 8.1(a)(i) hereof, notwithstanding any
investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing Date or the
decision of any party to complete the Closing, each party shall be entitled to
rely upon the representations and warranties of the other party or parties set
forth herein.

     8.5 Sole Remedy; Exceptions to Limitations; Etc.

     (a) Each Party's sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement
by any other Party shall be the provisions of Sections 8 and 9.8 hereof;
provided, however, that (i) nothing set forth in this Section 8 shall be deemed
to prohibit or limit any party's right at any time, on or after the Closing
Date, to seek injunctive or equitable relief for the failure of any other party
to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and (ii)
nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner any rights or
remedies which any Buyer Indemnified Party has, or might have, at law, in equity
or otherwise, against the Sellers, or which the Sellers have or might have
against the Buyer, based on any fraud or willful failure to fulfill any
agreement or covenant set forth herein.

     (b) Any indemnification payments made by the Buyer or the Sellers pursuant
to this Section 8 shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price hereunder.


                                       26

<PAGE>

     (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder for
any Claims arising from a breach of any representation or warranty regarding the
Company or the Sellers hereunder, and the amount of any damages incurred in
respect of any such breach shall not be included in the calculation of aggregate
damages subject to the Deductible, to the extent such liabilities or obligations
are fully reflected as current liabilities in the finally determined Closing
Balance Sheet.

     (d) If and when a Buyer Indemnified Party receives a claim or demand from a
third party for which the Buyer Indemnified Party has determined to assert an
indemnification claim hereunder for a breach of Section 3.13, or any other
Section, relating to any state income, sales, franchise or other similar state
Tax, the Buyer shall cause the Company to administer and respond to such third
party claim or demand in substantially the same manner as the manner in which
the Company's affiliates respond to similar third party claims and demands in
the ordinary course of business.

     8.6 Payment of Indemnification Obligations. In the event that either Seller
or the Buyer is required to make any payment under this Section 8, such party
shall promptly pay the Buyer Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party,
as the case may be, the amount of such indemnity obligation. If there should be
a dispute as to such amount, such Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall
nevertheless pay when due such portion, if any, of the obligation as shall not
be subject to dispute. The difference, if any, between the amount of the
obligation ultimately determined as properly payable under this Section 8 and
the portion, if any, theretofore paid shall bear interest for the period from
the date the amount was demanded by the Buyer Indemnified Party or the Sellers,
as the case may be, until payment in full, payable on demand, at the fluctuating
rate per annum which at all times shall be two percentage points in excess of
the "prime rate" from time to time of Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania or its
successor. So long as any amounts are held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement and are not subject to a previously asserted indemnification claim
(the "Available Escrow"), the Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other Buyer
Indemnified Party asserting an indemnity claim) shall first look to the
Available Escrow for payment of any indemnity claim and shall seek payment from
the Sellers for amounts, if any, in excess of the Available Escrow.

     8.7 Indemnification Procedure. All claims for indemnification under
Sections 8.1 and 8.2 hereof shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

     (a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an indemnifying party
(each an "Indemnifying Party") would be liable to an indemnified party (each an
"Indemnified Party") hereunder is asserted against an Indemnified Party by a
third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the
Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of such claim
or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
claim or demand) (the "Claim Notice"); provided that the failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not limit the rights of the Indemnified Party
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not
the Indemnifying Party disputes the Indemnifying Party's liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party does not dispute such liability, whether or not the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to defend against such claim or demand, provided that the Indemnified
Party is hereby authorized (but not obligated) prior to and during the Notice
Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading which the Indemnified Party
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified Party's
interests; provided that no such motion, answer or other pleading shall admit to
any allegation for which indemnity is sought in such a way that materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Party's right to defend against a claim or demand as
provided hereunder. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party does not
dispute the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify hereunder and desires
to defend the


                                       27

<PAGE>

Indemnified Party against such claim or demand and except as hereinafter
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend by appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings shall be settled or prosecuted by the
Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion within a reasonable period of time
under the circumstances. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but
not control, any such defense or settlement the Indemnified Party may do so at
the Indemnified Party's sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, whether by not
giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise, then
the Indemnified Party, without waiving any rights against the Indemnifying
Party, may settle or defend against any such claim in the Indemnified Party's
sole discretion and, if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party
is responsible therefor under this Section 8 then the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Party the amount of any settlement or
judgment and all indemnifiable costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party with
respect thereto, including interest as provided in Section 8.6 hereof.

     (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim without the consent
of the Indemnified Party if: (i) the amount of any such settlement exceeds the
Deductible, or (ii) the settlement will have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, assets, properties, prospects or condition (financial or
otherwise) of the Indemnified Party or the Company.

     (c) In the event the Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being
asserted against or sought to be collected by a third party, the Indemnified
Party shall with reasonable promptness send a Claim Notice with respect to such
claim to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes
such claim, the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

     (d) The procedures set forth in this Section 8.7(d) and Sections 8.7(a) and
(c) hereof shall not apply to claims or demands of a Buyer Indemnified Party
which, in the reasonable opinion of the Buyer, would be covered by the
Deductible.

     (e) The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the defense by an
Indemnifying Party of any third party claim that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such
claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
Party's request) the provision of books, records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such third party claim or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any such material provided hereunder.

     9. Miscellaneous.

<PAGE>

prior consultation of the other party, except as may be required by law or by

     9.7 Release. Effective as of the Closing and without the requirement of
taking any further action, each Seller hereby fully and forever remises,
releases, acquits and discharges the Company (for the benefit of the Company and
the Buyer) of and from any and all claims, demands, agreements, contracts,
covenants, promises, actions, compensation and benefits (including without
limitation current and future severance compensation; but excluding any unpaid
wages and salary compensation), suits, causes of action, obligations,
controversies, debts, costs, expenses, accounts, damages, judgments, losses and
liabilities of whatever kind or nature, at law or in equity or otherwise,

matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the date of
these presents, including without limitation all matters relating in any way to
any future termination of employment with the Company; provided that the
foregoing release shall in no way affect the rights of a Seller to seek
indemnification from the Company pursuant to the Company's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws for a claim against such Seller with respect to which
such Seller would be entitled to be so indemnified by the Company ("D&O
Indemnity") (i) to the extent that such claim does not arise out of or relate to
a matter for which the Company is entitled to indemnification from such Seller
pursuant to Section 8 hereto, or (ii) if such claim does arise out of or relate
to a matter for which the Company is entitled to indemnification from such
Seller pursuant to Section 8 hereto, then the amount of any D&O Indemnity
obligation of the Company shall be limited to (x) the amount by which the
Deductible has not been exceeded by all Buyer Indemnified Party claims that
would apply against the Deductible, plus (y) if but only after the Sellers have
made payments under Section 8 equal to the Cap, any remaining amount of such D&O
Indemnity claim. Any indemnification payments made by the Company to any Seller
for a D&O Indemnity claim under clause (ii)(x) of the preceding sentence shall
thereafter be included for the purpose of determining whether the Deductible has
been reached.

parties will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at

agreements, each party hereto shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief

renewals, replacements, substitutions, supplements, and restatements thereto and
thereof, as applicable.

          1.4 SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS. All of the schedules and exhibits attached

     2. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.


                                       13
<PAGE>

          2.1 THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. Each Lender severally and not
jointly agrees, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to make
Advances to Borrowers from time to time, as requested by Borrowing Agent or any
Borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, up to
a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding equal to such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of the Maximum Revolving Credit Facility Amount. The
Advances shall be evidenced by Borrowers' promissory notes (each, a "REVOLVING
CREDIT NOTE" and collectively, the "REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES") each in form and
substance satisfactory to Lenders.

          2.2 USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrowers agree that proceeds of the Revolving
Credit Facility may be used solely to (i) refinance certain existing
Indebtedness of Borrowers to National City Bank and The Bank on the Closing
Date, (ii) provide for future working capital requirements and for other general
corporate purposes of Borrowers, and (iii) fund Permitted Acquisitions.

     3. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

          3.1 ISSUANCE. Agent agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists and if requested by Borrowing Agent or any Borrower, to issue its
Letters of Credit for the account of any Borrower, provided that, in no event
shall the aggregate amount available to be drawn under issued and outstanding
Letters of Credit (a) exceed $10,000,000, or (b), when combined with the
aggregate of all then outstanding Advances, exceed the Maximum Revolving Credit
Facility Amount.

          3.2 REQUEST FOR LETTER OF CREDIT. Borrowing Agent or any Borrower may
request Agent to issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to Agent the applicable
commercial or standby letter of credit application (the "LETTER OF CREDIT
APPLICATION"), completed to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent and such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information as Agent may reasonably
request.

          3.3 DESCRIPTION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit shall,
among other things, (i) provide for the payment of sight or time drafts when
presented for honor thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof and when
accompanied by the documents described therein and (ii) have an expiration date
occurring not later than the earlier of (a) thirty (30) days prior to the last
day of the Contract Period or (b) twelve (12) months after such Letter of
Credit's date of issuance.

          3.4 REDUCTION OF AVAILABILITY. Availability under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be reduced by the total outstanding undrawn amount of all Letters
of Credit.

          3.5 INDEMNIFICATION. In connection with the issuance of any Letter of
Credit, Borrowers hereby indemnify, save and hold Agent and each Lender harmless
from any loss, cost, expense or liability, including, without limitation,
payments made by Agent and each Lender, and reasonable expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred by Agent and each Lender


                                       14

<PAGE>

arising out of, or in connection with any Letter of Credit to be issued or
created for any Borrower except to the extent any loss, cost, expense or
liability is attributable to Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Borrowers shall be bound by Agent's or any Lender's regulations and
good faith interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued or created for any
Borrower's account, although this interpretation may be different from such
Borrower's own, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be liable for any error,
negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any
Borrower's instructions or those contained in any Letter of Credit or any
modifications, amendments or supplements thereto or in creating or paying any
Letter of Credit, except for Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

          3.6 DISBURSEMENTS. Agent will promptly notify Borrowing Agent of the
presentment for payment under a Letter of Credit, following receipt by it of
such presentment, together with notice of the date such payment was made. All
disbursements under a Letter of Credit shall be deemed irrevocably to be a
request by Borrowers for an Advance on the date such disbursement was made.

          3.7 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Borrower's obligation to reimburse
Agent for disbursements described in SECTION 3.6 shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and regardless of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which any Borrower may have against Agent,
any Lender, or the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit (except in the event of
any such party's gross negligence or willful misconduct), including, without
limitation, any defense based upon any draft, demand or certificate or other
document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient, the failure of any disbursement or payment by Agent
under the Letter of Credit ("BANK PAYMENT") to conform to the terms of the
Letter of Credit (if such disbursement or Bank Payment is determined to be
appropriate and other than as a consequence of Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary
of the proceeds of such disbursement or Bank Payment or the legality, validity,
form, regularity or enforceability of the Letter of Credit.

          3.8 LENDER'S REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Lender shall, to the
extent of the percentage amount equal to the product of such Lender's Commitment
Percentage times the aggregate amount of all disbursements made with respect to
Letters of Credit, be deemed to have irrevocably purchased an undivided
participation in each Advance made as a consequence of such disbursement. In the
event that at the time a disbursement is made the unpaid balance of Advances
exceeds or would exceed, with the making of such disbursement, the Maximum
Revolving Credit Facility Amount and the amount in excess thereof is not
reimbursed by Borrowers within two (2) Business Days, Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender and upon Agent's demand each Lender shall pay to Agent such
Lender's Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed disbursement together with
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of Agent's unreimbursed costs and expenses
relating to such unreimbursed disbursement. Upon receipt by Agent of a repayment
from Borrowers of any amount disbursed by Agent for which Agent had


                                       15

<PAGE>

already been reimbursed by Lenders, Agent shall deliver to each Lender that
Lender's Commitment Percentage of such repayment. Each Lender's participation
commitment with respect to Letters of Credit shall continue until the last to
occur of the following events: (a) Agent ceases to be obligated to issue Letters
of Credit; (b) no Letter of Credit issued hereunder remains outstanding and
uncancelled and (c) all Persons including Agent (other than Borrowers) have been
fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit.

          3.9 CASH COLLATERAL. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of any Event of Default, at the option of Agent, Borrowers will pay to Agent,
for the ratable benefit of Lenders, cash in an amount equal to one hundred two
percent (102%) of the undrawn face amount of the Letters of Credit. Such cash
shall be held by Agent in a cash collateral account at Agent, subject to Agent's
sole control (the "CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") and, at such time as no further
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, will be
released to Borrowers to the extent not otherwise applied as provided herein.
Borrowers hereby pledge and grant to Agent a security interest in, all such cash
and other amounts held in the Cash Collateral Account from time to time and all
earnings thereof and Proceeds thereon, as security for the payment of all
Obligations. Agent shall release from the Cash Collateral Account and return to
Borrowers (i) any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal
to one hundred two percent (102%) of any single Letter of Credit as such Letter
of Credit expires and (ii) any funds remaining in the Cash Collateral Account
upon the satisfaction in full of the Obligations. If at any time, and from time
to time, the aggregate amount of the Cash Collateral Account exceeds one hundred
two percent (102%) of the undrawn face amount of all Letters of Credit then
issued and outstanding, Agent shall return any excess to Borrowers.

          3.10 WAIVER OF LIABILITY. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall assume
any risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof. Neither Agent nor any Lender (except in the event of its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct) shall be responsible for:

               (a) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
legal effect of the Letter of Credit or any document submitted by any party in
connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even
if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;

               (b) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
legal effect of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to
transfer or assign the Letters of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
Proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
ineffective for any reason;

               (c) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or
delivery of any messages by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise; or

               (d) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document or draft required in order to make a disbursement.


                                       16

<PAGE>

     None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of
the rights or powers granted Agent hereunder. In furtherance, and not in
limitation or derogation of any of the foregoing, any action taken or omitted to
be taken by Agent or any Lender with such Letters of Credit made in good faith
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon
Borrowers and shall not put Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, under any
resulting liability therefor.

     4. INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES.

          4.1 INTEREST.

               (a) RATES OF INTEREST. Interest shall accrue on the principal
amount of Prime Rate Loans outstanding at the end of each day (computed on the
actual days elapsed over a year of 365/366 days) at a fluctuating rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin. After the date hereof, the
foregoing rate of interest shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be,
by an amount equal to any increase or decrease in the Prime Rate, with such
adjustments to be effective as of the opening of business on the day that any
such change in the Prime Rate becomes effective. The Prime Rate in effect on the
date hereof shall be the Prime Rate effective as of the opening of business on
the date hereof. Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the LIBOR Rate
Loans outstanding at the end of each day (computed on the actual days elapsed
over a year of 360 days) at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate
for the applicable Rate Period plus the Applicable Margin.

               (b) DEFAULT RATE. Interest will accrue on the principal balance
of the Loans (including any principal balance previously accruing interest at a
LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin) after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default at a rate which is two percent (2%) in excess
of the Prime Rate plus the highest Applicable Margin set forth in the pricing
matrix contained in the definition of the term "Applicable Margin" (the "DEFAULT
RATE"). Borrowers acknowledge and agree that the Default Rate is reasonable in
light of the increased risk of collection of the sums due under the Loans after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and the costs
and expenses of Agent related thereto.

               (c) POST JUDGMENT INTEREST. Any judgment obtained for sums due
hereunder or under the Loan Documents will accrue interest at the applicable
Default Rate set forth above until paid.

               (d) MAXIMUM INTEREST. In no event whatsoever shall the aggregate
of all amounts deemed interest hereunder and charged or collected pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any law
which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem
applicable hereto. If any provisions of this Agreement are in contravention of
any such law, such provisions shall be deemed amended to conform thereto.


                                       17

<PAGE>

               (e) COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Interest, Letter of Credit
fees and unused commitment fees and collection charges hereunder shall be
calculated daily and, with respect to interest, shall be computed as provided in
SECTION 4.1 above. For the purpose of computing interest hereunder, all items of
payment received by Agent shall be deemed applied by Agent on account of the
Obligations (subject to final payment of such items) on the Business Day Agent
receives such items in immediately available funds.

          4.2 CLOSING FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Agent for its own account (and
not for the benefit of Lenders) a closing fee equal to $62,500, which shall be
fully earned and nonrefundable on the Closing Date and shall be paid
concurrently with the initial Loans hereunder.

          4.3 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

               (a) L/C FEE. For each Letter of Credit, Borrowers will pay to
Agent for the pro-rata benefit of Lenders a letter of credit fee (the "L/C FEE")
in an amount equal to (i) the then Applicable Margin for LIBOR Rate Loans, times
(ii) the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit (regardless of whether any conditions for drawing could then be
met and determined as of the close of business on any date of determination).
L/C Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears, and (ii) due and
payable on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the end of each March, June,
September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C expiration date and thereafter on
demand.

               (b) FRONTING FEE. Borrowers shall pay or reimburse Agent for its
own account, a fronting fee equal to (A) .125% per annum, times (B) the average
aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and
payable on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the end of each March, June,
September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period
(or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the
first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C
expiration date and thereafter on demand.

               (c) OTHER CUSTOMARY FEES. In addition, Borrowers shall pay or
reimburse Agent for its own account such customary administrative, issuance,
amendment, payment and negotiation charges to be mutually agreed upon by
Borrowers and Agent payable in connection with each Letter of Credit. Such
customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and
are nonrefundable.

          4.4 UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the pro
rata benefit of the Lender Group an unused commitment fee with respect to the
Revolving Credit Facility based upon the Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio on
a quarterly basis as reflected on the quarterly financial statements of KTI and
its consolidated Subsidiaries delivered to Agent pursuant to SECTION 12.3 and
the compliance certificates delivered to Agent pursuant to SECTION


                                       18

<PAGE>

12.7 for each quarter year ending after the Closing Date and determined in
accordance with the annual rate contained in the following pricing grid:

            < 2.5 to 1.0
</TABLE>

*    times the Average Unused Portion of the Maximum Revolving Credit Facility
     Amount.

     Such fee will be payable (i) quarterly in arrears on the first day of each
quarter beginning with the first day of the first fiscal quarter of 2007, and
(ii) on the date of termination or expiration of the Revolving Credit Facility,
pro-rated for the actual number of days in any partial quarter.

          4.5 AGENCY FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Agent for its own account (and
not for the benefit of Lenders) an annual agency fee equal to $10,000, which
agency fee shall be payable at such time that (i) three or more Lenders
(including Citizens) are parties to this Agreement, and (ii) the Borrowers,
Agent and Lenders have agreed to increase the Maximum Revolving Credit Facility
Amount to an amount exceeding $50,000,000, and on each anniversary date
thereafter.

     5. LOAN ADMINISTRATION.

          5.1 MANNER OF BORROWING. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility shall be as follows:

               (a) LOAN REQUESTS; PAYMENT.

                    (i) A request for an Advance that is to be a Prime Rate Loan
shall be made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following manner: (A)
Borrowing Agent or any Borrower may give Agent notice of its intention to
borrow, in which notice Borrowing Agent or Borrower, as applicable, shall
specify to Agent, the amount of the proposed borrowing and the proposed
borrowing date, no later than 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time on the requested
borrowing date (which shall be a Business Day); provided however, that no such
request may be made at a time when there exists an Event of Default; and (B) the
becoming due of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement, whether as
interest or for any other Obligation, shall


                                       19

<PAGE>

be deemed irrevocably to be a request by Borrowers for an Advance on the due
date in the amount required to pay such interest or other Obligation. Advances
that are LIBOR Rate Loans shall be requested in accordance with SECTION 5.4;
provided however, in no event may any Borrower request a LIBOR Rate Loan at any
time when a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
As an accommodation to Borrowers, Agent may permit telephonic requests for
Advances and electronic transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements
or reports to Agent by Borrowing Agent or Borrowers. Unless Borrowing Agent
specifically directs Agent in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or
electronic communications from Borrowing Agent or any Borrower, Agent shall have
no liability to any Borrower for any loss or damage suffered by any Borrower as
a result of Agent's honoring of any requests, execution of any instructions,
authorizations or agreements or reliance on any reports communicated to it
telephonically or electronically and purporting to have been sent to Agent by
any Borrower or by Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower and Agent shall
have no duty to verify the origin of any such communication or the authority of
the person sending it.

                    (ii) Each borrowing of Advances shall be advanced according
to the Commitment Percentages of Lenders.

                    (iii) Unless a Default or an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, payments shall be applied as designated by Borrowers to Agent
in writing. Otherwise, each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrowers on
account of the principal of and interest on the Advances shall be applied first
to Prime Rate Loans pro rata according to the applicable Commitment Percentages
of Lenders, then to LIBOR Rate Loans pro rata according to the applicable
Commitment Percentages of Lenders. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may discontinue such arrangement and
may apply such funds to costs, indemnities, fees, interest and principal,
constituting Obligations in such order as Agent, in its discretion elects.

                    (iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the immediately preceding clauses (ii) and (iii), commencing with the first
Business Day following the Closing Date, each borrowing of Advances shall be
advanced by Agent and each payment by Borrowers on account of Advances shall be
applied first to those Advances made by Agent. On or before 11:00 A.M.,
Philadelphia time, on each Settlement Date commencing with the first Settlement
Date following the Closing Date, Agent and Lenders shall make certain payments
as follows: (I) if the aggregate amount of new Advances made by Agent during the
preceding Business Day exceeds the aggregate amount of repayments applied to
outstanding Advances during such preceding Business Day, then each Lender shall
provide Agent with funds in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the
difference between (w) such Advances and (x) such repayments and (II) if the
aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Advances during such
Business Day exceeds the aggregate amount of new Advances made during such
Business Day, then Agent shall provide each Lender with its Commitment
Percentage of the difference between (y) such repayments and (z) such Advances.


                                       20

<PAGE>

                         (B) Each Lender shall be entitled to receive
disbursements of interest from Agent at the applicable rates of interest set
forth herein relating to outstanding Loans which it has funded.

                         (C) Agent shall, on the first Business Day of each
Week, submit to each Lender a certificate with respect to payments received and
Advances made during the Week immediately preceding such Business Day.

                    (v) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall at any time
receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by set-off) in a greater
proportion than any such payment to any other Lender, if any, in respect of such
other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate
payment is not expressly permitted hereunder, such Benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other
Lender's Loans, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share
the excess payment ratably with each Lender; provided however, that if all or
any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each
Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights
of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to
such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

                    (vi) Unless Agent shall have been notified by telephone,
confirmed in writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the amount
which would constitute its Commitment Percentage of the Advances available to
Agent, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender shall
make such amount available to Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. Agent will promptly notify
Borrowing Agent of its receipt of any such notice from a Lender. If such amount
is made available to Agent on a date after a Settlement Date, such Lender shall
pay to Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average
Federal Funds Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 365 days) during such
period as quoted by Agent, times (ii) such amount, times (iii) the number of
days from and including such Settlement Date to the date on which such amount
becomes immediately available to Agent. A certificate of Agent submitted to any
Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph (vi) shall be
conclusive, in the absence of manifest error; provided however, any Lender may,
within three (3) days after its receipt of the same, contest any such
certificate and Agent shall, upon receipt of any such contest, provide such
Lender with supporting documentation relating to the matters contained in such
certificate. If such amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such
Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Settlement Date, Agent shall be
entitled to recover such an amount, with interest thereon at the rate per annum
then applicable to Advances hereunder, on demand from Borrowers; provided
however, that Agent's right to such recovery shall not prejudice or otherwise
adversely affect Borrowers' rights (if any) against such Lender or relieve such
Lender of any obligation it may have to Borrowers.


                                       21

<PAGE>

                    (vii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event any Lender (x) has refused (which refusal constitutes a
breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) to make available
its portion of any Advance or (y) notifies either Agent or any Borrower that it
does not intend to make available its portion of any Advance (if the actual
refusal would constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this
Agreement) (each, a "LENDER DEFAULT"), all rights and obligations hereunder of
such Lender (a "DEFAULTING LENDER") as to which a Lender Default is in effect
and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express
provisions of this subsection while such Lender Default remains in effect.

                         (B) Loans shall be incurred pro rata from Lenders (the
"NON-DEFAULTING LENDERS") which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their
respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or
any pro rata share of any Advances required to be advanced by any Lender shall
be increased as a result of such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of
principal of any type of Loans shall be applied to reduce the applicable Loans
of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the outstanding Loans of that
type of all Lenders at the time of such application; provided that, such amount
shall not be applied to any Loans of a Defaulting Lender at any time when, and
to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Loans of any Non-Defaulting Lender
exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment Percentage of all Loans then
outstanding.

                         (C) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give
instructions to Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any
matters relating to this Agreement and the Loan Documents. All amendments,
waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the Loan Documents may be
made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, solely for purposes of the
definition of "Required Lenders", a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be
a Lender and not to have Loans outstanding.

                         (D) Other than as expressly set forth herein, the
rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to
indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in
this subsection shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its
obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, shall alter such
obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender
hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, Agent or any other
Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such
Defaulting Lender hereunder.

                         (E) In the event a Defaulting Lender cures to the
satisfaction of Agent and Borrowers all outstanding breaches which caused a
Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be
a Defaulting Lender and shall be treated as a Lender under this Agreement.

          5.2 DISBURSEMENT. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Agent to
disburse the proceeds of each Advance requested, or deemed to be requested as
provided herein by


                                       22

<PAGE>

transferring into the Operating Accounts the amount of the Advance, or otherwise
in accordance with procedures acceptable to Agent.

          5.3 AUTHORIZATION. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, in
Agent's sole discretion, to advance to each Borrower, and to charge to
Borrowers' Loan Account hereunder as an Advance, a sum sufficient to pay all
interest accrued on the Obligations and all principal coming due on the
Obligations during the immediately preceding month and to pay all costs, fees
and expenses at any time owed by Borrowers to Agent and Lenders hereunder to the
extent such amounts are not paid when due.

          5.4 LIBOR RATE LOANS. Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION
5.1(A)(I) herein, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a LIBOR Rate Loan,
Borrowing Agent or such Borrower shall give Agent prior written irrevocable
notice no later than 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time on the 3rd Business Day prior
to the requested borrowing date specifying (i) a Borrower's election to obtain a
LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day), (iii) the amount to be borrowed, which amount shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $250,000 and may increase in integral multiples of
$250,000 and (iv) the applicable Rate Period selected by Borrowing Agent or by
such Borrower. In no event shall Borrowers be permitted to have outstanding at
any one time more than ten (10) LIBOR Rate Loans.

          5.5 CONVERSION OF PRIME RATE LOANS. Provided that no Event of Default
has occurred which is then continuing, any Borrower may, on any Business Day,
convert any Prime Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan. If a Borrower desires to
convert a Prime Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan, such Borrower or Borrowing
Agent on behalf of such Borrower, shall give Agent not less than three (3)
Business Days' prior written notice (prior to 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time on
such Business Day), specifying the date of such conversion, the amount to be
converted and the Rate Period selected by the applicable Borrower with respect
to such converted Prime Rate Loan. Each conversion into or conversion of a LIBOR
Rate Loan shall be in a minimum principal amount of $250,000 and may increase in
integral multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof. After giving effect to any
conversion of Prime Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans, Borrowers shall not be
permitted to have outstanding at any one time more than ten (10) LIBOR Rate
Loans.

          5.6 CONTINUATION OF LIBOR RATE LOANS. Borrowers shall have the right
on three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice given to Agent by
Borrowing Agent, subject to the provisions of SECTION 5.7, to continue any LIBOR
Rate Loan into a subsequent Rate Period of the same or a different permitted
duration, in each case subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (a) in the case of a continuation of less than all LIBOR Rate
Loans, the LIBOR Rate Loans continued shall each be in a minimum principal
amount of $250,000 and may increase in integral multiples of $250,000;


                                       23
<PAGE>

               (b) accrued interest on a LIBOR Rate Loan (or portion thereof)
being continued shall be paid by Borrowers at the time of continuation; and

               (c) no LIBOR Rate Loan (or portion thereof) may be continued as a
LIBOR Rate Loan if an Event of Default has occurred which is then continuing or
if, after giving effect to such continuation, Borrowers shall have outstanding
more than ten (10) separate LIBOR Rate Loans in the aggregate.

     If any Borrower or Borrowing Agent on behalf of a Borrower shall fail to
give timely notice of its election to continue any LIBOR Rate Loan or portion
thereof as provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted
hereunder, such LIBOR Rate Loan or portion thereof, unless such LIBOR Rate Loan
shall be repaid, shall automatically be converted into a Prime Rate Loan at the
end of the Rate Period then in effect with respect to such LIBOR Rate Loan.

          5.7 PREPAYMENT. Subject to the provisions of SECTION 5.8, Borrowers
may prepay any Loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time, without
premium or penalty; provided that a LIBOR Rate Loan prepaid, continued or
converted other than on the last Business Day of the then current Rate Period
with respect thereto shall be subject to SECTION 5.8 below. Borrowers shall
specify the date of prepayment of Loans which are LIBOR Rate Loans and the
amount of Loans to be prepaid. In the event that any prepayment of a LIBOR Rate
Loan is made on a date other than the last Business Day of the then current Rate
Period with respect thereto, Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders
therefor in accordance with SECTION 5.8 hereof.

          5.8 INDEMNIFICATION. Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders and
hold Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses
that Agent and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment
on any date other than the last Business Day of the then current Rate Period or
any default by any Borrower in the payment of the principal of or interest on
any LIBOR Rate Loan or failure by any Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a
prepayment of or conversion of or to a LIBOR Rate Loan after notice thereof has
been given, including (but not limited to) any interest payable by Agent or
Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its
LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, and any other loss or expense incurred by Agent and
Lenders by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by Agent and Lenders to make, continue, convert into or maintain, a
LIBOR Rate Loan.

          5.9 INABILITY TO MAKE LIBOR RATE LOANS. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any
change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it
unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans, or if with
respect to any Rate Period, any Lender is unable to determine the LIBOR Rate
relating thereto prior to such Rate Period, or prior to any Rate Period, adverse
or unusual conditions in, or changes in applicable law relating to, the London
interbank eurodollar market make it, in the reasonable judgment of any Lender,
impracticable to fund therein any of the LIBOR Rate Loans or make the projected
LIBOR Rate unreflective of the


                                       24

<PAGE>

actual costs of funds therefor to any Lender, the obligation of any Lender to
make LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder shall forthwith be suspended during the pendency
of such circumstances and each Borrower shall, if any affected LIBOR Rate Loans
are then outstanding, promptly upon written request from any such Lender,
convert such affected LIBOR Rate Loans into Prime Rate Loans at the end of the
then-current Rate Period with respect thereto, or sooner if required by law,
treaty, regulation or directive or the interpretation or application thereof as
herein provided; provided however, in the event any such sooner conversion is
required, no Borrower shall be required to indemnify Agent and Lenders pursuant
to SECTION 5.8 herein with respect to such conversion; but provided further,
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to alter or affect any obligations that
any Borrower may have to any Lender under any interest rate protection
agreement.

          5.10 BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR. In the
event that Agent or the Required Lenders shall have determined prior to the
first day of any Rate Period that (a) reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Rate Period, or (b) Dollar deposits in the
principal amount of the relevant Loan and for such Rate Period are generally not
available in the London interbank eurodollar market with respect to a proposed
LIBOR Rate Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Prime Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate
Loan, Agent shall give Borrowing Agent prompt written, telephonic or telegraphic
notice of the determination of such effect. If such notice is given, (i) any
such requested LIBOR Rate Loan shall be made as a Prime Rate Loan, unless
Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent no later than 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time
three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing that the
request for such borrowing shall be canceled or made as an unaffected type of
LIBOR Rate Loan, and (ii) any Prime Rate Loan which was to have been converted
to an affected type of LIBOR Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted into a
Prime Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 11:00
A.M. Philadelphia time three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion,
shall be maintained as an unaffected type of LIBOR Rate Loan. Nothing in this
section shall affect the interest payable on, or the Rate Period in effect with
respect to, any LIBOR Rate Loan during any Rate Period which commenced prior to
the date of such written notice.

          5.11 CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

               (a) DETERMINATION. In the event that Agent or any Lender shall
have determined that any change in, or the introduction, adoption,
effectiveness, interpretation, re-interpretation or phase-in after the date
hereof of any applicable law or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any
change after the date hereof in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency after
the date hereof, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
Agent's or any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
a level below that which Agent or any Lender could have achieved but


                                       25

<PAGE>

for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration Agent's and
each Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
Agent or any Lender to be material, then, from time to time, upon written demand
not later than thirty (30) days following such Lender's or Agent's making such
determination (which demand shall be accompanied by a certification
demonstrating the calculation of such amounts in reasonable detail) by Agent or
such Lender, Borrowers shall pay to Agent or such Lender such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such reduction as shall
be set forth in such written demand. In determining such amount or amounts,
Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution methods.
The protection of this section shall be available to Agent or any Lender
regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability with
respect to the applicable law or condition.

               (b) CERTIFICATE. A certificate of an officer of Agent or such
Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate
Agent or such Lender pursuant to this section and the calculation thereof and
the reasons therefor when delivered to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

          5.12 INCREASED COSTS. In the event that any change, after the date of
this Agreement, in any applicable law or treaty, or in the interpretation or
application thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other financial, monetary or other regulatory authority after the date hereof,
shall:

               (a) (1)subject Agent or any Lender to any tax with respect to
this Agreement (other than (a) any tax based on or measured by net income or
otherwise in the nature of a net income tax, including, without limitation, any
franchise tax or any similar tax based on capital, net worth or comparable basis
for measurement and (b) any tax collected by a withholding on payments and which
neither is computed by reference to the net income of the payee nor is in the
nature of an advance collection of a tax based on or measured by the net income
of the payee) or (2) change the basis of taxation of payments to Agent or any
Lender of principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder or
under any Loan Documents (other than in respect of (a) any tax based on or
measured by net income or otherwise in the nature of a net income tax,
including, without limitation, any franchise tax or any similar tax based on
capital, net worth or comparable basis for measurement and (b) any tax collected
by a withholding on payments and which neither is computed by reference to the
net income of the payee nor is in the nature of an advance collection of a tax
based on or measured by the net income of the payee);

               (b) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except any
reserve taken into account in the determination of the applicable LIBOR Rate),
special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or
deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit
extended by, any office of Agent or any Lender, including (without limitation)
pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System; or


                                       26

<PAGE>

               (c) impose on Agent or any Lender or the London interbank
eurodollar market any other condition with respect to any Loan Document;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any
Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Loans hereunder by an amount that
Agent or such Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any payment
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the Loans by
an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material, then, in any such
case, Borrowers shall pay Agent or such Lender, upon its demand and
certification not later than thirty (30) days following its receipt of written
notice of the imposition of such increased costs, such additional amount as will
compensate Agent or such Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as
the case may be, to the extent Agent or such Lender has not otherwise been
compensated, with respect to a particular Loan, for such increased cost as a
result of an increase in the Prime Rate or LIBOR Rate. An officer of Agent or
such Lender shall determine the amount of such additional cost or reduced amount
using reasonable averaging and attribution methods and shall certify the amount
of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowers, which certification
shall include a written explanation of such additional cost or reduction to
Borrowers and the calculation thereof. Such certification shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

     6. PAYMENTS.

          6.1 INTEREST PAYMENTS. Borrowers will pay to Agent (for the pro rata
benefit of Lenders) interest on the principal balance of Prime Rate Loans on the
tenth (10th) day of each calendar month, commencing on November 10, 2006 and on
the expiration of the Contract Period. Borrowers will pay (for the pro rata
benefit of Lenders) interest on the principal balance of LIBOR Rate Loans on the
last day of each Rate Period; provided that, for any LIBOR Rate Loan with a Rate
Period in excess of three (3) months, Borrowers will pay (for the pro rata
benefit of Lenders) interest on the principal balance of such LIBOR Rate Loan on
the three (3) month anniversary of the extension of such LIBOR Rate Loan and on
the last day of the applicable Rate Period.

          6.2 PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. Principal payable on account of Advances shall
be payable by Borrowers to Agent immediately upon the earliest of (a) the
occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of which Agent accelerates the
maturity and payment of the Obligations as expressly permitted hereunder, or (b)
the expiration of the Contract Period.

          6.3 PAYMENT METHOD. Borrowers irrevocably authorize Agent to debit all
payments required to be made by Borrowers hereunder, under the Loans or under
any of the Loan Documents, on the date due, from any deposit or checking account
maintained by any Borrower with Agent (including without limitation, the
Operating Accounts). If there are insufficient funds in such accounts, or Agent
for any reason does not debit such accounts and provides notice of such intent
not to debit such accounts to Borrowers two (2) Business Days in advance,
Borrowers will make such payments directly to Agent at the offices of Agent
located at 2001 Market Street, Suite 600, Philadelphia, PA 19103, or such other
place as Agent may from time to time specify in writing. All payments are to be
made in immediately available funds, without counterclaim or setoff and free and
clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for, any taxes or other
payments. If Agent accepts payment in any other form, such payment


                                       27

<PAGE>

shall not be deemed to have been made until the funds comprising such payment
have actually been received by or made available to Agent.

          6.4 MAINTENANCE OF LOAN ACCOUNTS; STATEMENTS OF OBLIGATIONS. Agent
shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (a "LOAN
ACCOUNT") on which the applicable Borrowers will be charged with all Loans to
such Borrowers or for such Borrowers' account, including, accrued interest,
Lender Group Expenses, and any other Obligations of Borrowers. Agent shall
render statements regarding the Loan Account to Borrowing Agent, including
principal, interest, fees, and including an itemization of all charges and
expenses constituting Lender Group Expenses owing, and such statements shall be
conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate, and shall constitute an
account stated between Borrowers and the Lender Group, subject only to manifest
error, unless, within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by Borrowing Agent,
Borrowing Agent shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing the
error or errors contained in any such statements.

     7. COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES.

          7.1 GENERAL. Borrowers will collect their Accounts only in the
ordinary course of business. All Account collections of Borrowers will be
deposited in one or more operating account(s) maintained by Borrowers at Agent
(the "OPERATING ACCOUNTS"); provided, however, that Borrowers shall be entitled
to maintain their existing operating accounts, if any, for a period of six (6)
months from the Closing Date.

          7.2 REMITTANCE OF ITEMS; ENDORSEMENTS. Following the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, immediately upon receipt of any
notes, instruments or chattel paper, each Borrower, and such other persons shall
remit the same or cause the same to be remitted, in kind, to Agent. Each
Borrower shall, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, deliver or cause to be delivered to Agent, with appropriate
endorsement and assignment to Agent with full recourse to Borrowers, all
instruments, notes and chattel paper constituting an Account or proceeds
thereof. Agent is hereby authorized, following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to open all mail addressed to any Borrower
and endorse all checks, drafts or other items for payment on behalf of any
Borrower. Agent (and Agent's officers, employees and agents) are granted a power
of attorney by each Borrower with full power of substitution to execute,
following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, on
behalf of each Borrower and in any Borrower's name or to endorse any Borrower's
name on any check, draft, Instrument, note or other item of payment or to take
any other action or sign any document in order to effectuate the foregoing. Such
power of attorney being coupled with an interest is irrevocable.

     8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. In order to induce the Lender Group to
enter into this Agreement, Borrowers, jointly and severally, make the following
representations and warranties which shall be true, correct, and complete in all
respects as of the date hereof, and shall be true, correct, and complete in all
respects as of the Closing Date, and at


                                       28

<PAGE>

and as of the date of the making or entering into each Advance or Letter of
Credit, thereafter, as though made on and as of the date of such Advance or
Letter of Credit (except to the extent that such representations and warranties
relate solely to an earlier date) and such representations and warranties shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

and authority to execute, deliver and comply with the Loan Documents, and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or
qualified as a foreign corporation or limited liability company in good standing
under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which the character or location of
the properties owned by it or the business transacted by it requires such
licensing or qualification, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

               (b) Each of Borrowers' Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited
liability company duly incorporated or formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation (or,

liability company in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in
which the character or location of the properties owned by it or the business
transacted by it requires such licensing or qualification, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified could not reasonably be expected to cause
a Material Adverse Change.

          8.2 LICENSES. Each Borrower and each of its employees, servants and
agents have all licenses, registrations, approvals and other authority as may be
necessary to enable them to own and operate their business and perform all
services and business which they have agreed to perform in any state,
municipality or other jurisdiction, except where the failure to maintain such
licenses, registrations, approvals or other authority could not reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

          8.3 OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. As of the date hereof, the ownership of all
stock, options, warrants and other equity securities of each Borrower (other
than KTI) and all pledges, proxies, voting trusts, powers of attorney and other

          8.4 SUBSIDIARIES. As of the date hereof, except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 8.4 attached hereto, no Borrower owns any shares of stock or other
equity interests in any Person, directly or indirectly (by any Subsidiary or

bankruptcy or reorganization cases. No capital stock (or any securities,
Instruments, warrants, options, purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights,

capital stock) of any direct or indirect Subsidiary of any Borrower is subject
to the issuance of any security, instrument, warrant, option, purchase right,
conversion or exchange right, call, commitment or claim of any right, title, or
interest therein or thereto.

          8.5 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Borrowers have furnished to Agent (i) the
audited consolidated and unaudited consolidating financial statements of KTI and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, together with all

fairly present the financial condition and the assets and liabilities of KTI and
its consolidated Subsidiaries at such dates, and have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. With respect to the interim statements, such statements
are subject to year-end adjustment and any accompanying footnotes.

          8.6 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN FINANCIAL CONDITION. There has been

or actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of Borrowers'
knowledge, threatened against or affecting any Borrower, at law or in equity or
before or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental department,
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign which
could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

          8.8 DUE AUTHORIZATION; NO LEGAL RESTRICTIONS. The execution and
delivery by Borrowers of the Loan Documents, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the fulfillment and
compliance with the respective terms, conditions and provisions of the Loan
Documents: (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate or member
(as the case may be) action of each Borrower, (b) will not conflict with or
result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or might, upon the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both, constitute a default) under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any applicable statute, law, rule, regulation
or ordinance or any Borrower's Certificate or Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws
or Operating Agreement or any lease, indenture, mortgage, loan or credit
agreement or instrument to which any Borrower is a party or by which any of them
may be bound or affected, or any judgment or order of any court or governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, (c) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien of any
nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of any Borrower under the
terms or provisions of any such agreement or instrument, and (d) does not

or any other Person except such consents or approvals as have been obtained.


                                       30

<PAGE>

          8.9 ENFORCEABILITY. The Loan Documents have been duly executed by
Borrowers and delivered to Agent and constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of Borrowers, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

          8.10 NO DEFAULT UNDER OTHER OBLIGATIONS, ORDERS OR GOVERNMENTAL
REGULATIONS. No Borrower is in violation of its Certificates or Articles of
Incorporation or Formation or in default in the performance or observance of any
of its obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any indenture or other
agreement creating, evidencing or securing any Indebtedness or pursuant to which
any such Indebtedness is issued, except where such violation could not
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change. No Borrower is in
violation of or in default under any other agreement or instrument or any
judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation, applicable to
it or by which its properties may be bound or affected, except where such
violation or default could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material
Adverse Change.

          8.11 GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. No consent, approval or authorization of
or designation, declaration or filing with or notice to any governmental
authority on the part of any Borrower is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by any Borrower of the Loan Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, except for filings
required under the Exchange Act.

          8.12 TAXES. Borrowers' FEINs are as set forth on SCHEDULE 8.12. As of
the date hereof, each Borrower has filed all tax returns which it was required
to file prior to the date hereof and has paid, or made provision for the payment
of, all taxes which have or may have become due pursuant to such returns or
reasonably expected to be paid pursuant to any assessment received by it. Such
tax returns are complete and accurate in all material respects and no Borrower
knows of any proposed additional assessment or basis for any assessment of
additional taxes.

          8.13 NAMES AND ADDRESSES. During the past five (5) years, no Borrower
has been known by any names (including trade names) other than those set forth
in SCHEDULE 8.13 attached hereto and its chief executive office has not been
located at any addresses other than those set forth on SCHEDULE 8.13 attached
hereto. SCHEDULE 8.13 identifies the chief executive offices of each Borrower.

          8.14 CURRENT COMPLIANCE. Each Borrower is currently in compliance with
all of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.

          8.15 PENSION AND BENEFIT PLANS.

               (a) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 8.15 hereto, (a) no Borrower
has any obligations with respect to any Pension Plan, (b) no ERISA Events,
including, without limitation, any "Reportable Event" or "Prohibited
Transaction" (as those terms are defined under ERISA), have occurred in
connection with any Pension Plan of any Borrower which might


                                       31

<PAGE>

constitute grounds for the termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC or for
the appointment by any United States District Court of a trustee to administer
any such Pension Plan, (c) all of Borrowers' Pension Plans meet with the minimum
funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA, if applicable, and (d) no Borrower
has any existing liability to the PBGC. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 8.15
hereto, no Borrower is subject to or bound to make contributions to any
Multi-Employer Plan.

               (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
any of the Pension Plans (other than a Multi-Employer Plan), determined as of
the end of such Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent
actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the
assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term "benefits
liabilities" has the meaning specified in Section 4001 of ERISA and the terms
"current value" and "present value" have the meanings specified in Section 3 of
ERISA. No Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliates have incurred withdrawal liability
(and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liability) under Section 4201 or
4204 of ERISA.

          8.16 LEASES AND CONTRACTS. Each Borrower has complied with the
provisions of all leases, contracts or commitments of any kind (such as
employment agreements, collective bargaining agreements, powers of attorney,
distribution agreements, patent license agreements, contracts for future
purchase or delivery of goods or rendering of services, bonus, pension and
retirement plans or accrued vacation pay, insurance and welfare agreements) to
which any Borrower is a party and is not in default thereunder, except where
such failure to comply or default could not reasonably be expected to cause a
Material Adverse Change. To the best of each Borrower's knowledge, no other
party is in default under any such leases, contracts or other commitments and no
event has occurred which, but for the giving of notice or the passage of time or
both, would constitute an event of default thereunder, except where such default
or potential event of default could not reasonably be expected to cause a
Material Adverse Change.

          8.17 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each Borrower, to the best of its
knowledge, owns or possesses the right to use all of the patents, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses, franchises and permits (which
for the purposes hereof, shall be deemed to exclude professional licenses and
permits) and rights with respect to the foregoing necessary to own and operate
such Borrower's properties and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and presently planned to be conducted without conflict with the rights of
others, except where the failure to own or possess such rights could not
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

          8.18 BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS. Within five (5) years prior to the date
hereof, neither the business nor operations of any Borrower has been materially
and adversely affected in any way by any casualty, strike, lockout, combination
of workers, order of the United States of America, or any state or local
government, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, directed against any
Borrower. As of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the best of each


                                       32

<PAGE>

Borrower's knowledge, threatened labor disputes, strikes, lockouts or similar
occurrences or grievances against the business being operated by any Borrower.

          8.19 ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. No representation or
warranty by any Borrower contained herein or in any certificate or other
document furnished by any Borrower pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
fails to contain any statement of material fact necessary to make such
representation or warranty not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which it was made. As of the date hereof, there is no material fact which any
Borrower knows and has not disclosed to Agent, which does or may materially and
adversely affect any Borrower or any of its or their operations taken as a
whole.

          8.20 SOLVENCY. As of the date hereof, each Borrower is Solvent. No
transfer of property is being made by any Borrower and no obligation is being
incurred by any Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with the intent to hinder, delay, or
defraud either present or future creditors of any Borrower.

          8.21 COMMON ENTERPRISE. The successful operation and condition of each
Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the functions
of all of the Borrowers as a whole. Each Borrower expects to derive benefit (and
its board of directors has determined that it may reasonably be expected to
derive benefit), directly and indirectly, from successful operations of its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries. Each Borrower expects to derive benefit (and the
boards of directors of each Borrower have determined that they may reasonably be
expected to derive benefit), directly and indirectly, from the credit extended
by Lenders hereunder, both in their separate capacities and as members with the
other Borrowers of an interrelated group of companies. Each Borrower has
determined that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
any other Loan Documents to be executed by it as a Borrower is within its
corporate purposes and will be of direct and indirect benefit to such Borrower
and is in its best interest.

     9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. Each Borrower, jointly and severally, covenants
and agrees that, so long as any Lender has any commitment to lend hereunder and
until full and final payment of the Obligations, and unless Agent shall
otherwise consent in writing, each Borrower shall comply with the following:

          9.1 PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE. Borrowers
will pay when due all Obligations without setoff, deduction or counterclaim.

          9.2 CLAIMS FOR LABOR AND MATERIALS. Each Borrower will pay or cause to
be paid when due all taxes, assessments, governmental charges or levies imposed
upon it or its income, profits, payroll or any property belonging to it
including without limitation all withholding taxes and all claims for labor,
materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon any
of its properties or assets, except to the extent that such a failure to pay or
cause to be paid would not constitute an Event of Default under SECTION 17.1(D)
of this Agreement and except and to the extent any such amounts are being
actively contested in


                                       33

<PAGE>

good faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers maintain adequate
reserves on their books therefor.

          9.3 EXISTENCE; APPROVALS; QUALIFICATION; BUSINESS OPERATIONS;
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Borrower will, and will cause all of its Subsidiaries
formed in the United States and the first tier foreign Subsidiaries to obtain,
preserve and keep in full force and effect its separate corporate or limited
liability company existence, except as otherwise permitted by SECTION 10.5 of
this Agreement. Each Borrower will, and will cause all of its Subsidiaries
formed in the United States and the first tier foreign Subsidiaries to (as
applicable): (a) obtain, preserve and keep in full force and effect all rights,
franchises, permits, licenses, registrations and franchises necessary to the
proper conduct of their business or affairs, (b) qualify and remain qualified as
a foreign corporation or limited liability company in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of the properties owned by it or the business
transacted by them requires such qualification, (c) continue to operate its
business as presently operated and maintain in full force and effect all
licenses and other qualifications to do business as shall be required to do so,
and (d) comply with the requirements of all applicable laws and all rules,
regulations (including without limitation environmental statutes and
regulations, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Americans With Disabilities
Act) and orders of regulatory agencies and authorities having jurisdiction over
it; all except where any such failure could not reasonably be expected to cause
a Material Adverse Change.

          9.4 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Each Borrower will maintain, preserve,
protect and keep or cause to be maintained, preserved, protected and kept its
real and personal property used or useful in the conduct of its business in good
working order and condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and will pay and
discharge when due the cost of repairs to and maintenance of the same.

          9.5 INSURANCE.

               (a) At their expense, Borrowers shall keep their property insured
against loss or damage by fire, theft, explosion, sprinklers, and all other
hazards and risks, as are ordinarily insured against by other owners in similar
businesses, in amounts and with such companies as are reasonably acceptable to
Agent, but in any event in amounts sufficient to prevent Borrowers from becoming
a co-insurer under such policies and in addition, will carry business
interruption insurance in such amounts as may be reasonably required by Agent.
Any material decrease of any insurance policy or coverage requested by any
Borrower must be approved by Agent in writing prior to the effective date of
such modification.

               (b) Borrowers shall cause to be delivered to Agent the insurance
policies and all endorsements thereto and evidence of insurance utilizing a
current ACORD 27 Evidence of Property Insurance as of the Closing Date.

               (c) Borrowers shall bear the full risk of loss from any loss of
any nature whatsoever with respect to their property.

          9.6 INSPECTIONS; EXAMINATIONS.

               (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs all
accountants and auditors employed by any Borrower to exhibit and deliver to
Agent copies of any and all of Borrowers' financial statements, trial balances
or other accounting records of any sort in the accountant's or auditor's
possession and copies of all reports submitted to Borrowers by such accountants
or auditors, including management letters, "comment" letters and audit reports,
and to disclose to Agent any information they may have concerning any Borrower's
financial status and business operations, as to each and every one of which
actions each Borrower hereby expressly consents. After the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, each Borrower further authorizes all
federal, state and municipal authorities to furnish to Agent copies of reports
or examinations relating to any Borrower, whether made by a Borrower or
otherwise.

               (b) If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred which is
then continuing, (i) the officers of Agent, or such Persons as Agent may
designate, may visit and inspect any of the properties of any Borrower, examine
(either by Agent's employees or by independent accountants) any of the assets of
Borrowers, including the Books of Borrowers, and discuss the affairs, finances
and accounts of Borrowers with their officers and with their independent
accountants at such times as Agent may desire; and (ii) Agent may conduct, at
any time and from time to time, and Borrowers will fully cooperate with, a field
examination of the Accounts and business affairs of Borrowers. Provided that no
Event of Default or Default has occurred and is continuing, such visits,
inspections and field examinations shall be at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice by Agent. If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred
which is then continuing, Borrowers will pay all costs and expenses of Agent
related to such visits, inspections and field examinations.

          9.7 PENSION PLANS. Each Borrower will (a) keep in full force and
effect any and all Pension Plans which are presently in existence or may, from
time to time, come into existence under ERISA, unless such Pension Plans can be
terminated without material liability to Borrowers in connection with such
termination (as distinguished from any continuing funding obligation); (b) make
contributions to all of each Borrower's Pension Plans in a timely manner and in
a sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of ERISA; (c) comply with
all material requirements of ERISA which relate to such Pension Plans so as to
preclude the occurrence of any Reportable Event, Prohibited Transaction or
material "accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined in ERISA; and
(d) notify Agent immediately upon receipt by any Borrower of any notice of the
institution of any proceeding or other action which may result in the
termination of any Pension Plan and deliver to Agent, promptly after the filing
or receipt thereof, copies of all reports or notices which any Borrower files or
receives under ERISA with or from the Internal Revenue Service, the PBGC, or the
U.S. Department of Labor with respect to any Pension Plan.

          9.8 BANK ACCOUNTS. Within one-hundred eighty (180) days of the date
hereof, each Borrower other than KTIC will maintain its primary deposit account

respects to all Obligations and will not make any payments thereon, except as
approved by Agent in writing.

          9.11 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FUTURE ACTIONS. Each Borrower will, at
its sole cost, take such actions and provide Agent from time to time with such
agreements, documents or information as Agent may in its reasonable discretion
deem necessary or advisable to carry out the terms of the Loan Documents.

          9.12 TAXES. Each Borrower will cause all material assessments and

levied, or assessed against any Borrower or any of its property to be paid in
full, before delinquency or before the expiration of any extension period,
except and to the extent any such amounts are being actively contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers maintain adequate reserves on
their books therefor. Each Borrower shall make due and timely payment or deposit
of all such material federal, state, and local taxes, assessments, or
contributions required of it by law, and will execute and deliver to Agent, on
demand, appropriate certificates attesting to the payment thereof or deposit
with respect thereto, except and to the extent any such amounts are being
actively contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers
maintain adequate reserves on their books therefor. Each Borrower will make

and except and to the extent any such amounts are being actively contested in
good faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers maintain reasonable
reserves on their books therefor.

          9.14 NOTICES. Borrowing Agent will promptly notify Agent of (a) any

<PAGE>

          13.1 REPRESENTATIONS. Each Borrower represents as follows: (a) the
Environmental Affiliates are in material compliance with all Environmental
Requirements and no Borrower has any knowledge of any circumstances which may
prevent or interfere with such material compliance in the future; (b) the
Environmental Affiliates have or are in the process of obtaining all material
licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations required under applicable
Environmental Requirements; (c) there are no pending or threatened claims
against any of the Environmental Affiliates or any of their assets related to
the failure to comply with any Environmental Requirements which could result in
a Material Adverse Change, or any facts or circumstances which could give rise
to such a claim; (d) no facility or property now or previously owned, operated
or leased by any Environmental Affiliate is an Environmental Cleanup Site; (e)
no Environmental Affiliate has treated, stored, transported, handled or disposed
of Special Materials at any Environmental Cleanup Site in violation of the

(f) there are no liens or claims for cost reimbursement outstanding or
threatened against any Environmental Affiliate or any of their assets which
could result in a Material Adverse Change, or to the best of each Borrower's
knowledge, any facts or circumstances which could give rise to such a lien or
claim.

          13.2 REAL PROPERTY. Each Borrower warrants and represents that there
are no Special Materials presently located on or near any real property owned,
leased or operated by any Environmental Affiliate (collectively, "REAL
PROPERTY") except for Special Materials which are and have at all times been
treated, stored, transported, handled, and disposed of in material compliance
with all Environmental Requirements. Each Borrower represents to Lenders that to
the best of each Borrower's knowledge, the Real Property is not now being used
nor, to the best of each Borrower's knowledge, has it ever been used in the past
for activities involving Special Materials, including but not limited to the
use, generation, collection, storage, treatment, or disposal of any Special
Materials except for Special Materials which are and have at all times been
treated, stored, transported, handled and disposed of in material compliance
with all Environmental Requirements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Real Property is not being used nor, to the best of each

impoundment or other area for the treatment, storage or disposal of solid waste
(including solid waste such as sludge), except with respect to such solid waste
to be stored or processed for recycling and/or beneficial reuse, in material
compliance with Environmental Requirements.

          13.3 COVENANT REGARDING COMPLIANCE. Each Borrower shall take or cause
all Environmental Affiliates to take, at Borrower's and such Environmental
Affiliate's sole expense, such actions as may be necessary to materially comply
with all Environmental Requirements. If any Environmental Affiliate shall fail
to take such action or fail to assert a defense to an allegation by a
governmental agency that a Borrower and/or an Environmental Affiliate has
violated an Environmental Requirement, and such failure may reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change in Borrower's operations, Lender
may make advances or payments towards performance or satisfaction of the same
but shall be under no obligation to do so. All sums so advanced or paid,
including all sums advanced or paid by Lender in connection with any


                                       44

<PAGE>

judicial or administrative investigation or proceeding relating thereto,
including, without limitation, attorney's fees, fines, or other penalty
payments, shall be at once repayable by Borrowers and all sums so advanced or
paid shall become a part of the Lender Indebtedness.

     The Environmental Affiliates will maintain all material licenses, permits,
approvals and authorizations required under applicable Environmental
Requirements.

          13.4 NOTICES. In the event any Borrower becomes aware of any past,
present or future facts or circumstances not identified on SCHEDULE 13, which
have given rise or could give rise to a claim against any Environmental

Borrowers will promptly give Lender notice thereof, together with a written
statement of an officer of Borrowers setting forth the details thereof and the
action with respect thereto taken or proposed to be taken by the Environmental
Affiliates.

          13.5 INDEMNITY. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold

Agent or the Lender Group, for all loss, liability, damage, cost and expenses,
including, without limitation, attorney's fees and disbursements (including the
reasonable allocated cost of in-house counsel and staff) arising from or related
to (a) the release of any Special Materials in violation of the Environmental
Requirements at any facility at any time owned, leased or operated by any
Borrower or any Environmental Affiliate, (b) the release of any Special
Materials in violation of the Environmental Requirements treated, stored,
transported, handled, generated or disposed of by or on behalf of any Borrower
or any Environmental Affiliate at any third party owned site, (c) any claim
against any Borrower or any Environmental Affiliate that they have failed to
comply with all Environmental Requirements, and (d) the breach by any Borrower
of any representation or covenant in this ARTICLE 13.

          13.6 TESTING. After the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default
and during the continuance thereof, Agent shall have the right from time to time
to designate such persons ("ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS") as Agent may select to
visit, inspect, examine and test all properties owned or operated by and all
products and wastes generated, treated, stored, transported, handled or disposed
of by or on behalf of any Environmental Affiliate, for the purpose of
investigating compliance with Environmental Requirements, any actual or
potential claims related thereto, and any condition which could result in
potential liability, cost or expenses to any Lender if Lender has a reasonable
basis to suspect such non-compliance, actual or potential claim, and/or such
condition. Subject to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this
paragraph, each Borrower will permit, and will cause all Environmental
Affiliates to permit, such Environmental Consultants to have access to all of
such properties, products and wastes and all books, records and reports related
to compliance by the Environmental Affiliates with all Environmental
Requirements. Subject to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this
paragraph, each Borrower will supply, and will cause all Environmental
Affiliates to supply, Agent or the Environmental Consultants with all
non-privileged information, records,

correspondence, audits, reviews and materials related to compliance by the
Environmental Affiliates with all Environmental Requirements and will make
available to Lender or the Environmental Consultants appropriate personnel
employed by or consultants retained by the Environmental Affiliates having
knowledge of such matters.

     The cost of such visits, inspections, examination and tests shall be borne
by Borrowers. In the event Agent or any Lender pays such costs, such sums shall
be at once repayable by Borrowers and all sums so advanced or paid by Agent or
any Lender, shall become part of the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to perform any tests,
examinations or inspections or to monitor the Environmental Affiliates'
compliance with all Environmental Requirements. Upon request from Borrowers,
Agent shall, after receipt by Agent, deliver complete copies of all findings,
tests/sampling results and reports, regarding the activities undertaken by or on
behalf of or at the request of Agent at the properties. Agent agrees to cause
any Environmental Consultant prior to accessing any of Borrowers' properties to

injury, death or property damage resulting from activities described in this
ARTICLE 13 in form, content and amount acceptable to Agent in its reasonable
discretion and consistent with industry standards for such parties.

contained in this ARTICLE 13, including without limitation the indemnification
obligation of Borrowers, shall survive the occurrence of any event whatsoever,
including the payment of the Lender Indebtedness or any investigation by or

               (n) A breach by any Borrower occurs under any material agreement,

          17.2 REMEDIES. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Agent may (and if directed by the Required Lenders shall), at
its election, without notice of its election and without demand, do any one or
more of the following, all of which are authorized by Borrowers:

               (a) Declare the entire unpaid principal of the Loans, all other
Obligations (including without limitations all contingent reimbursement
obligations under any Letters of Credit), or any part thereof, all interest
accrued thereon, all fees due hereunder and all other obligations of Borrowers
to Lenders hereunder or under any other Loan Document otherwise arising
immediately due and payable;

               (b) Cease advancing money, issuing Letters of Credit or otherwise
extending credit to or for the benefit of Borrowers under this Agreement, under
any of the Loan Documents, or under any other agreement between Borrowers and
the Lender Group;

               (c) Convert any Loans earning interest at LIBOR Rate plus
Applicable Margin to Loans earning interest at the Prime Rate plus Applicable
Margin and require Borrowers to indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or
expense which such Lender has sustained or incurred as a consequence of such
conversion in accordance with SECTION 5.8;

               (d) Charge interest at the Default Rate;

               (e) Terminate this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents
as to any future liability or obligation of Agent or Lenders, but without
affecting the Obligations;

               (f) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits
of Borrowers held by the Lender Group, and any amounts received in the Operating
Account, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;
and/or

               (g) Exercise each and every right and remedy granted to it under
the Loan Documents and under any other applicable law or at equity.

     If an Event of Default occurs under SECTIONS 17.1(F) OR (G), all of the
Obligations shall become immediately due and payable.

          17.3 SET-OFF. Without limiting the rights of each member of the Lender
Group under applicable law, each Borrower grants to each member of the Lender
Group and agrees that each member of the Lender Group may without notice to any
Borrower (such notice being expressly waived), and without constituting a
retention of any collateral in satisfaction of any Obligations (within the
meaning of Section 9-620 of the Uniform Commercial Code), at any time and from
time to time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, exercise a right of set-off, a lien against and a security interest in
all property of Borrowers now or at any time in such member of the Lender
Group's possession in any capacity whatsoever, including but not limited to any
balance of any deposit, trust or agency account, or


                                       54

<PAGE>

any other account with any member of the Lender Group, including Deposit
Accounts, as security for the Obligations. At any time and from time to time
following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any
member of the Lender Group may without notice or demand, set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such member of the
Lender Group to or for the credit of any Borrower against any or all of the
Obligations.

          17.4 TURNOVER OF PROPERTY HELD BY LENDER. Each Borrower irrevocably
authorizes any Affiliate of any member of Lender Group, following the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the request of any member
of the Lender Group and without further notice, to turn over to Agent any
property of any Borrower held by such Affiliate, including without limitation,
funds and securities for any Borrower's account and to debit, for the benefit of
the Lender Group, any Deposit Account maintained by any Borrower with such
Affiliate (even if such Deposit Account is not then due or there results a loss
or reduction of interest or the imposition of a penalty in accordance with law
applicable to the early withdrawal of time deposits), in the amount requested by
Agent up to the amount of the Obligations, and to pay or transfer such amount or
property to Agent (for the pro-rata benefit of the Lender Group) for application
to the Obligations.

          17.5 DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. Neither the failure nor any delay
on the part of Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, power or
privilege under the Loan Documents upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
or otherwise shall operate as a waiver thereof or impair any such right, remedy,
power or privilege. No waiver of any Event of Default shall affect any later
Event of Default or shall impair any rights of Agent or any Lender. No single,
partial or full exercise of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges by Agent
or any Lender shall preclude further or other exercise thereof. No course of
dealing between Agent or any Lender and any Borrower shall operate as or be
deemed to constitute a waiver of Agent's or any Lender's rights under the Loan
Documents or affect the duties or obligations of Borrowers.

          17.6 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive, but shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to all other rights, remedies, powers and privileges in
Agent's or any Lender's favor at law or in equity.

          17.7 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND DISCRETION. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, whenever Agent's or any Lender's consent or approval is
required or permitted or any documents are required to be acceptable to Agent or
any Lender, such consent, approval or acceptability shall be at the sole and
absolute discretion of Agent or such Lender. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, whenever any determination or act is at Agent's or any Lender's
discretion, such determination or act shall be at Agent's or such Lender's sole
and absolute discretion.

          17.8 CERTAIN FEES, COSTS, EXPENSE EXPENDITURES. Each Borrower agrees
to pay on demand the following cost and expenses of the Lender Group (the
"LENDER GROUP EXPENSES"):

               (a) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal costs, expenses and charges) incurred
or paid by (i) Agent in connection with advising, structuring, drafting,
preparing, reviewing, negotiating the Loan Documents or any waivers, consents,
amendments, extensions, modifications or restatements related thereto; (ii) any
member of the Lender Group in connection with enforcing, protecting, preserving,
defending or terminating any of the Loan Documents or any of the Lender Group's
rights and remedies related thereto, irrespective of whether suit is brought
(including without limitation, all costs and expenses and attorneys' fees
related to any "workout," "restructuring," insolvency or similar proceeding
involving any Borrower); and (iii) any member of the Lender Group in connection
with negotiations regarding or the defense or prosecution of any legal
proceedings involving, any claim (including third-party claims) made or
threatened against any member of the Lender Group related to or involving the
Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated under the Loan Documents or any
actions taken pursuant to the Loan Documents by the Lender Group;

               (b) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred or paid
by Agent for administering the Loan Documents, including photocopying;
notarization; couriers; messengers; telecommunications; public record searches
(including without limitation, real estate, tax lien, litigation, UCC,
bankruptcy, patent, trademark, copyright or motor vehicle department searches);
filing; recording; publication; environmental audits; and accounting or other
professional advisors;

               (c) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred or paid
by any member of the Lender Group in connection with the disbursement of funds
under the Loan Documents (by wire transfer or otherwise); the dishonoring of
checks, drafts or other items of payment; correction or cure of any Default or
Event of Default or enforcement of the Loan Documents; or exercising any rights
or remedies under the Loan Documents; and

               (d) any and all stamp and other taxes payable or determined to be
payable in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and
all liabilities to any member of the Lender Group may become subject as the
result of delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes.

     In the event any Borrower shall fail to pay taxes, insurance, assessments,
fees, costs or expenses which it is required to pay hereunder, Agent in its sole
discretion, may make expenditures for such purposes and the amount so expended
(including attorney's fees and expenses, filing fees and other charges) shall be
payable by Borrowers on demand and shall constitute part of the Obligations.


                                       56

<PAGE>

     With respect to any amount required to be paid by Borrowers under this
Section, in the event Borrowers fail to pay such amount on demand, at Agent's
option, all of said amounts required to be paid by Borrowers, may be charged by
Agent as a Prime Rate Loan and Borrowers shall also pay to Agent interest
thereon at the Default Rate. Each Lender shall reimburse Agent for such Lender's
Pro-Rata Share of such Loan in accordance with the terms of SECTION 5.1. If any
Lender fails to reimburse Agent for such Lender's Pro Rata Share, such Lender
shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender or be subject to the Defaulting Lender
provisions set forth in SECTION 5.1(A)(VII)(A).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent agrees that Borrowers will not be
obligated to pay to Agent or any Lender an amount in excess of $50,000 for
attorneys' fees incurred or paid by Agent or any member of the Lender Group in
connection with advising, structuring, drafting, preparing, reviewing and/or
negotiating the Loan Documents for any period up to and including the Closing
Date.

     18. REGARDING AGENT.

          18.1 APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby designates Citizens to act as
Agent for such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to
exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to or required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof
and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and Agent shall hold
all collateral, payments of principal and interest, fees, charges and
collections received pursuant to this Agreement, for the ratable benefit of
Lenders. Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agent
or employees. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement,
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding; provided however, that Agent
shall not be required to take any action which exposes Agent to liability or
which is contrary to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or applicable
law unless Agent is furnished with an indemnification reasonably satisfactory to
Agent with respect thereto.

          18.2 NATURE OF DUTIES. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be
(i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in
connection herewith, unless caused by their gross negligence (but not mere
negligence) or willful misconduct or (ii) responsible in any manner for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Borrower or any
officer thereof contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Documents or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other


                                       57

<PAGE>

Loan Documents or for any failure of any Borrower to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower.
The duties of Agent as respects the Loans to Borrowers shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature and shall be performed by Agent with the same care and
skill as it would exercise in its capacity as agent when dealing with loans of
similar size and complexity for other lenders; Agent shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as
to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as
expressly set forth herein.

          18.3 LACK OF RELIANCE ON AGENT AND RESIGNATION.

               (a) Independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other
Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Borrower in
connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and the
taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith, and (ii) its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of Borrowers. Agent shall have no duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into
its possession before making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter
except as shall be provided by Borrowers pursuant to the terms hereof. Agent
shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document,
certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or of the
financial condition of any Borrower, or be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions
or conditions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
financial condition of any Borrower, or the existence of any Event of Default or
any Default.

               (b) Agent may resign upon written notice to each of Lenders and
Borrowing Agent. The Required Lenders will promptly designate a successor Agent
which in the absence of an Event of Default shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Borrowers. Any such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
duties of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective
upon its appointment. Effective upon its resignation the former Agent's rights,
powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act
or deed on the part of such former Agent. After any Agent's resignation as
Agent, the provisions of this SECTION 18.3 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement.

          18.4 CERTAIN RIGHTS OF AGENT. If Agent shall request instructions from
Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent shall be
entitled to refrain from such act or


                                       58

<PAGE>

taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from
the Required Lenders; and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by
reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders shall not have
any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of its acting or
refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the
Required Lenders.

          18.5 RELIANCE. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement,
certificate, telex, teletype or facsimile message, cablegram, order or other
document or telephone message believed in good faith by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity,
and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected
by it. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for
the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
Agent with reasonable care.

          18.6 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. Except as specifically set forth in this
SECTION 18.6, Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, unless Agent has received written notice from a Lender or from a
Borrower or Borrowing Agent referring to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, describing such Default or Event of Default. In the event that Agent
receives such a notice, or to the extent that Agent shall otherwise have actual
knowledge that an Event of Default has occurred, Agent shall give notice thereof
to Lenders. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided
that, unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of Lenders. Agent shall, upon the taking of any such
action(s), provide Lenders with notice (which may be by telephone) of the same.

          18.7 INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed and
indemnified by the Borrowers, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify Agent
according to its Commitment Percentage from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in performing its duties hereunder, or
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document; provided that, Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross negligence (but
not mere negligence) or willful misconduct.

          18.8 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. With respect to the obligation
of Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Loans made by it shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing
the duties as Agent specified herein; and the term "Lender" or any similar term
shall, unless the context clearly otherwise


                                       59

<PAGE>

indicates, include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Agent may
engage in business with any Borrower ("OTHER TRANSACTIONS") as if it were not
performing the duties specified herein and may accept fees and other
consideration from any Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement
or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.

          18.9 BORROWERS' UNDERTAKING TO AGENT. Without prejudice to its
obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, each
Borrower hereby undertakes with Agent to pay to Agent from time to time on
demand all amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of
Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent not
already paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto
satisfy Borrowers' obligations to make payments for the account of the Lender
Group or the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement.

     19. INDEMNIFICATION AND OTHER PROVISIONS.

          19.1 INDEMNIFICATION. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, the Lender Group, their Affiliates and their officers, directors,
shareholders, employees and agents (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"),
from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses (whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party to any litigation),
including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and costs, settlement
costs and costs of investigation, document production, attendance at depositions
or other discovery, incurred by any Indemnified Party with respect to, arising
out of or as a consequence of (a) this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, including without limitation, any failure of Borrowers to pay when
due (at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, fee or
any other amount due under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or any
other Event of Default; (b) the use by Borrowers of any proceeds advanced
hereunder; (c) the transactions contemplated hereunder; or (d) any claim,
demand, action or cause of action being asserted against (i) any Borrower or any
of its Affiliates by any other Person, or (ii) any Indemnified Party by any
Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary, no Borrower shall
be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Party from any
liability, loss or damage resulting from the willful misconduct, gross
negligence or unlawful actions of such Indemnified Party. Any amount payable to
the Lender Group under this Section will bear interest at the Default Rate from
the due date until paid.

          Borrowers' obligations under this Section shall survive termination of
this Agreement and repayment of the Obligations.

          19.2 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence in Borrowers'
performance of their obligations under the Loan Documents.

     20. COMMUNICATIONS AND NOTICES. All notices, requests and other
communications made or given in connection with the Loan Documents shall be in
writing and, unless receipt is stated herein to be required, shall be deemed to

contained in this Section shall affect the right of Agent or any Lender to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of Agent
or any Lender to bring any action or proceeding against any Borrower or its
property in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

     23. SALE AND ASSIGNMENT.

          23.1 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS; NEW LENDERS.


                                       62

<PAGE>

               (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of Borrowers, Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the Notes and their
respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Agent and each Lender.

               (b) Each Borrower acknowledges that in the regular course of
commercial banking business one or more Lenders may at any time and from time to
time sell participating interests in the Loans to other financial institutions
(each such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a "TRANSFEREE").
Each Lender shall provide written notice to Agent and Borrowing Agent of any
sales of participating interests made by each Lender. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Transferee, such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any Note for all
purposes under this Agreement, and the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each Transferee may exercise all
rights of payment (including without limitation rights of set-off) with respect
to the portion of such Loans held by it or other Obligations payable hereunder
as fully as if such Transferee were the direct holder thereof provided that no
Borrower shall be required to perform any of its obligations under any Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, any payment obligations) to, or take
any direction from, any Transferee and in no event shall any Borrower be
required to pay to Agent, any Lender or any other Person for the benefit of any
Transferee more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to
Lender which granted an interest in its Loans or other Obligations payable
hereunder to such Transferee had such Lender retained such interest in the Loans
hereunder or other Obligations payable hereunder and in no event shall any
Borrower be required to pay any such amount arising from the same circumstances
and with respect to the same Loans or other Obligations payable hereunder to
both such Lender and such Transferee. Each Borrower hereby grants to any
Transferee a continuing security interest in any deposits, moneys or other
property actually or constructively held by such Transferee as security for the
Transferee's interest in the Loans. No such participation shall create a direct
contractual relationship between any Borrower and any such Transferee, and no
Transferee shall be given (i) the right to instruct the Lender to take or to
refrain from taking any action hereunder, or (ii) any voting rights hereunder
(other than for reductions or postponements of any amounts constituting
principal or interest on any Loans payable hereunder).

               (c) Any Lender may sell, assign or transfer its rights under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to one or more additional banks or
financial institutions reasonably acceptable to Agent and Borrowers, and one or
more additional banks or financial institutions may commit to make Loans
hereunder (each a "PURCHASING LENDER"); provided however that Borrowers shall
have no right to approve a Purchasing Lender following the occurrence and during
the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, pursuant to a Commitment
Transfer Supplement in form substantially similar to that set forth on EXHIBIT B
hereto (each, a "COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT"), executed by a Purchasing
Lender, the


                                       63

<PAGE>

transferor Lender, and Agent and delivered to Agent for recording, provided
however that any transfer of less than all of any Lender's rights hereunder or
any transfer to a Person who is not a Lender hereunder shall be in minimum
amounts of not less than $10,000,000. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance
and recording, from and after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to
such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with a Commitment
Percentage as set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be
released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer
Supplement creating a novation for that purpose (it being understood that all
outstanding obligations of the transferor Lender shall either be satisfied by
such transferor Lender or assumed by the Purchasing Lender). Such Commitment
Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and
only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender
and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the
purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and
obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Borrowers hereby consent to the addition of such Purchasing Lender
and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the
purchase by such Purchasing Lender in accordance with the terms of this SECTION
23.1(C) of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor
Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Borrowers shall, to
the extent reasonable, execute and deliver such further documents and do such
further reasonable acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing.

               (d) Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment
Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "REGISTER") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender from time to time. The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error,
and Borrowers, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for the purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any
Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of $5,000 payable by the
applicable Purchasing Lender upon the effective date of each transfer or
assignment to such Purchasing Lender.

               (e) Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Transferee or Purchasing Lender and any prospective Transferee or Purchasing
Lender any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning
Borrowers which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of Borrowers
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation
of such Borrowers.

               (f) Each Borrower agrees to take all actions that Agent may
reasonably request in attempting to sell, transfer or assign any of its rights
or interest under this Agreement. Such actions include, but are not limited to,
(a) Borrowers causing senior management and representatives of Borrowers to be
available to participate in information


                                       64

<PAGE>

meetings with prospective Purchasing Lenders at such times and places as Agent
may reasonably request, and (b) Borrowers providing Agent with all information
reasonably requested by Agent in order to accomplish such sale, transfer or
assignment.

               (g) In addition to the foregoing provisions, any Lender may at
any time pledge or assign all or any portion of its rights under the Loan
Documents (including any portion of any Note) to any of the twelve (12) Federal
Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12, U.S.C.
Section 341. No such pledge or assignment or enforcement thereof shall release
any Lender from its obligations under any of the Loan Documents or substituting
any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     24. BORROWING AGENCY.

          24.1 BORROWING AGENCY PROVISIONS.

               (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates Borrowing Agent
to be its attorney and agent and in such capacity to borrow, sign and endorse
notes, and execute and deliver all instruments, documents, writings and further
assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower or
Borrowers, and hereby authorizes Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds
hereunder in accordance with the request of Borrowing Agent.

               (b) The handling of this credit facility as a co-borrowing
facility with a borrowing agent in the manner set forth in this Agreement is
solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at their request. Neither Agent nor
any Lender shall incur liability to Borrowers as a result thereof. To induce
Agent and Lenders to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby
indemnifies Agent and each Lender and holds Agent and each Lender harmless from
and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and claims of
damage or injury asserted against Agent or any Lender by any Person arising from
or incurred by reason of the handling of the financing arrangements of Borrowers
as provided herein, reliance by Agent or any Lender on any request or
instruction from Borrowing Agent or any other action taken by Agent or any
Lender with respect to this SECTION 24.1 except due to willful misconduct or
gross (not mere) negligence by the indemnified party.

               (c) All Obligations shall be joint and several, and each Borrower
shall make payment upon the maturity of the Obligations by acceleration or
otherwise, and such obligation and liability on the part of each Borrower shall
in no way be affected by any extensions, renewals and forbearance granted by
Agent or any Lender to any Borrower, failure of Agent or any Lender to give any
Borrower notice of borrowing or any other notice, any failure of Agent or any
Lender to pursue or preserve its rights against any Borrower, and such agreement
by each Borrower to pay upon any notice issued pursuant thereto is unconditional
and unaffected by prior recourse by Agent or any Lender to the other Borrowers
or the lack thereof.

          24.2 SUBROGATION. Each Borrower expressly waives any and all rights of
subrogation, reimbursement , indemnity, exoneration, contribution of any other
claim which such


                                       65

<PAGE>

Borrower may now or hereafter have against the other Borrowers or other Person
directly or contingently liable for the Obligations hereunder, or against or
with respect to the other Borrowers' property, arising from the existence or
performance of this Agreement, until termination of this Agreement and repayment
in full of the Obligations.

     25. MISCELLANEOUS.

          25.1 MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.

               (a) The Required Lenders and Borrowers may, subject to the
provisions of this SECTION 25.1, from time to time enter into written
supplemental agreements to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents executed
by Borrowers, for the purpose of adding or deleting any provisions or otherwise
changing, varying or waiving in any manner the rights of Lenders, Agent or
Borrowers thereunder or the conditions, provisions or terms thereof or waiving
any Default or Event of Default thereunder, but only to the extent specified in
such written agreements; provided however, that no such supplemental agreement
shall without the consent of Agent and the Lender Group (i) increase the
Commitment Percentage of any Lender, (ii) extend the final maturity of any Note
or any scheduled due date under SECTION 2.1 hereof, or decrease the rate of
interest or reduce any fee payable by any Borrower to any such Lender pursuant
to this Agreement, (iii) alter the definition of the term Required Lenders or
alter, amend or modify this SECTION 25.1, (iv) change the rights and duties of
Agent, (v) increase the Loans; or (vi) release any Borrower from any of its
obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.

               (b) Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each
Lender and shall be binding upon Borrower, Lenders and Agent and all future
holders of the Obligations. In the case of any waiver, Borrowers, Agent and
Lenders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of
Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of
a specific Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default
(whether or not the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of
Default which was waived), or impair any right resulting from such subsequent
Event of Default.

          25.2 BROKERS. The transaction contemplated hereunder was brought about
and entered into by the Lender Group and Borrowers acting as principals and
without any brokers, agents or finders being the effective procuring cause
hereof. Each Borrower represents to the Lender Group that no Borrower has
committed the Lender Group to the payment of any brokerage fee or commission in
connection with this transaction. If any such claim is made against the Lender
Group by any broker, finder or agent or any other Person, each Borrower agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold the Lender Group harmless against any such claim,
at Borrowers' own cost and expense, including the Lender Group's attorneys'
fees. Each Borrower further agrees that until any such claim or demand is
adjudicated in the Lender Group's favor, the amount claimed and/or demanded
shall be deemed part of the Obligations.


                                       66

<PAGE>

          25.3 USE OF AGENT'S OR LENDER'S NAME. No Borrower shall use the name
of any member of the Lender Group or the name of any Affiliate of any member of
the Lender Group in connection with any of their business or activities except
as may otherwise be required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any like regulatory body and except as may be required in
their dealings with any governmental agency.

          25.4 NO JOINT VENTURE. Nothing contained herein is intended to permit
or authorize any Borrower to make any contract on behalf of the Lender Group,
nor shall this Agreement be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture
or making the Lender Group an investor in any Borrower.

          25.5 SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by any Borrower in the Loan Documents or made by or on their

delivery of the Loan Documents, any investigation at any time made by the Lender
Group or on their behalf and the making by the Lender Group of the loans or
advances to Borrowers. All statements contained in any certificate, statement or
other document delivered by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant hereto or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed
representations and warranties by Borrowers.

          25.6 NO ASSIGNMENT. No Borrower may assign any of its rights hereunder
without the prior written consent of Agent.

          25.7 PUBLICITY. Agent may use its discretion in disclosing the fact,
but not the terms and conditions, of the financing under this Agreement to any

          25.8 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement and all rights and powers granted
hereby will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

          25.9 SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement and all other Loan
Documents are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of
any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall
continue in full force and effect.

          25.10 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The rights and benefits of this
Agreement and the Loan Documents shall not inure to the benefit of any third
party.

          25.11 HOLIDAYS. If the day provided herein for the payment of any
amount or the taking of any action falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday
at the place for payment or action, then the due date for such payment or action
will be the next succeeding Business Day.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Pitman,
New Jersey  &#151; October&nbsp;5, 2006 </B> &#151;  K-Tron International, Inc. (NASDAQ-KTII) today
announced the acquisition of all of the stock of privately-held Premier Pneumatics, Inc.
(&#147;Premier&#148;), a leading manufacturer of pneumatic conveying and bulk handling equipment for the
North American market. The purchase price was $27.565&nbsp;million, all of which was paid in cash,
including a $2&nbsp;million escrow. The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on Premier&#146;s net
working capital on the closing date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Premier, which is based in Salina, Kansas, manufactures and markets a complete line of components
for pneumatic conveying systems. Premier and its predecessors have been in the pneumatic conveying
business for over 50&nbsp;years, and the company is well-known for its Aerolock<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> rotary valve,
Series&nbsp;II 2400 vacuum receiver, blower package and diverter valve product lines. Premier is also
known for its engineered systems for rail car and truck unloading, as well as for its
storage-to-production-line transfer systems which are used in the plastics, compounding, food and
chemical industries. The company has a large installed base of systems, resulting in significant
repeat business from established customers. For the trailing 12-month period ended August&nbsp;31,
2006, Premier&#146;s unaudited revenues were approximately $25.8&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Top operating management of Premier is expected to remain following the acquisition, including Mike
Wedel, Vice President Sales and Marketing, Todd Smith, Vice President Engineering and
Manufacturing, and Gary Lee, Vice President Finance. Kevin Bowen, Senior Vice President of K-Tron
responsible for the K-Tron Process Group, will also serve as President of Premier.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Commenting on the acquisition, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Edward B. Cloues, II
said, &#147;The acquisition of Premier significantly expands the scope of K-Tron&#146;s activities in the
pneumatic conveying business, which we entered in 1997, and in the solids feeding business where
K-Tron has been a global leader for many years with its volumetric and gravimetric screw and belt
feeders. The combination of these two market leaders will enable both K-Tron and Premier to offer
their customers integrated pneumatic conveying and feeding systems with engineering, manufacturing,
commissioning and after-sale services from a single source, something that is not widely available
today. In addition, K-Tron&#146;s extensive global network of wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent
sales representatives is an ideal platform on which to expand Premier&#146;s scope beyond the North
American market.&#148; Robert Korbelik, the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">previous owner and retiring President of Premier, added, &#147;We view the fit of our Premier business
with K-Tron as being ideal for our company and our employees since we are each a market leader and
serve many of the same customers. I am also enthusiastic about the combination because both
businesses are known for their high standards when it comes to product quality and customer
satisfaction.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">While indicating that K-Tron does not intend to provide guidance to the market with respect to
future earnings, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues said that he expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per
share in the fourth quarter of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On a related matter, K-Tron also announced that on September&nbsp;29, it and its U.S. subsidiaries
entered into a Loan Agreement with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania. This credit facility provides
K-Tron and these subsidiaries until September&nbsp;29, 2011 with a $50&nbsp;million unsecured revolving line
of credit. The $27.565&nbsp;million purchase price for Premier was borrowed under this new facility, and
the Company also borrowed $9.7&nbsp;million thereunder to repay all of its other bank indebtedness,
except for a mortgage note with a principal balance of $1.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries design, produce, market and service material
handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industrial markets. The Company has
manufacturing facilities in the United States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and its
equipment is sold throughout the world.
