                    -----------------------------------------
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   ------------------------------------------
                                  July 4, 1998
                                  ------------
                                   (Unaudited)
1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("K-Tron" or the "Company").
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
been made. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 1998 which
was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash paid in the first
six months of 1998 and 1997 for interest was $.3 million and $.6 million,
respectively, and for income taxes was $1.2 million and $1.2 million,
respectively.

3. Earnings per Share

In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128
requires that the Company report Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share. Basic
Earnings Per Share represents net income less preferred dividends divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted Earnings Per Share is
calculated similarly, except that the denominator includes weighted average
common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of options, warrants,
convertible securities and other instruments with dilutive effects if exercised.

The Company's Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share are calculated as follows:

ITEM 2.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Results of Operations

         For the second quarter and first six months of 1998, the Company
reported net income of $1,815,000 and $3,122,000, respectively, compared to
$1,252,000 and $2,302,000 in the same periods in 1997.

         K-Tron is an international company with approximately 59% of its
revenues derived from products manufactured and services performed from its
facilities outside the United States, primarily in Europe. As such, the
financial position and performance of the Company is sensitive to both
translation and transaction fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
("foreign exchange rates").

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

         Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of operations
into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly
with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark. In addition, revenues and
income of the Company with respect to particular transactions may be affected by
changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in other currencies,
including in particular the U.S.

         Total revenues increased by $.6 million or 2.8% in the second quarter
of 1998 and by $.7 million or 1.7% in the first six months of 1998 when compared
to the same periods in 1997. The increase in revenues would have been greater
except for the lower exchange translation rates of certain currencies into U.S.
dollars. If the average foreign exchange translation rates for the second
quarter and first six months of 1998 were applied to the same periods in 1997,
revenues would have increased 4.3% for the quarter and 3.7% for first six
months.

         Gross profit as a percent of revenues improved to 46.4% for the second
quarter of 1998 and 45.7% for the first six months of 1998, as compared to 45.0%
and 44.4%, respectively, for the same periods in 1997. The improvement in gross
margin in 1998 was primarily due to sales mix and increased volume in local
currencies.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased by $.1
million or 1.9% for the second quarter of 1998 and remained constant for the
first six months of 1998, as compared to the same periods in 1997. The second
quarter increase in SG&A was due to higher selling expenses in local currencies,
offset by lower foreign exchange translation rates previously described.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures remained constant for the
second quarter and first six months of 1998, as compared to the same periods in
1997. R&D expenses increased in local currencies due to the development of new
product enhancements, but these increases were offset by lower foreign exchange
translation rates.

         Interest expense decreased by $.2 million or 53.8% for the second
quarter of 1998 and by $.3 million or 43.8% for the first six months of 1998, as
compared to the same periods in 1997, primarily due to lower debt levels, lower
rates on some loans and lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of
1998 were 22.4% and 25.3%, respectively, compared to 27.3% and 25.4% for the
same periods in 1997. The effective tax rates for 1998 were lower than the same
periods in 1997 due to increased income generated by the Company's Swiss
subsidiary enabling the Company to utilize foreign net operating loss carry
forwards that formerly had valuation allowances.

         The backlog increased by 34.4% at the end of the second quarter when
compared to the end of 1997 and increased by 21.9% when compared to the same
period in 1997 in each case at constant foreign exchange rates.

         In June 1998, the Company's U.S. manufacturing subsidiary refinanced
its bank debt. The new loan facilities consist of a mortgage loan with a maximum
availability of $2.7 million and a two year secured revolving credit facility
with maximum availability of $5.0 million. As of July 4, 1998, outstanding debt
under the mortgage loan was $2.1 million with no borrowings under the revolving
credit facility. Upon completion of the third quarter 1998 stock repurchase
discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had
borrowings of $2.7 million under the mortgage loan and $1.95 million under the
revolving credit loan.

         Total debt decreased by $2.9 million in the first six months of 1998,
of which $.6 million was due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.
Total debt without the effect of the foreign exchange translation decreased by
$2.3 million. European and U.S. debt decreased by $2.1 million and $.2 million,

respectively.  At July 4, 1998, the Company had $5.6 million of availability
under its U.S. loan agreements and $3.7 million of availability under its Swiss
loan agreements.

         At July 4, 1998, there was working capital of $12.1 million as compared
to $9.4 million at January 3, 1998, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was 1.54 and 1.41, respectively.

         In the first six months of 1998 and 1997, the Company utilized earnings
from operations and internally-generated funds to meet its working capital needs
and reduce debt.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 million in the first
six months of 1998 as compared to $6.6 million in the same period of 1997. The
lower operating cash flow was primarily from an increase in accounts receivable
and inventories.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 1998
and 1997 was for capital additions.

         Net cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 1998
and 1997 was for the reduction of debt and was provided by operating activities.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease in
shareholders' equity of $.5 million in the first six months of 1998.

         ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         (a)      The Annual Meeting of the shareholders of the Company was held
                  on May 5, 1998.

         (b)      Not applicable.

         (c)      Shareholders of the Company were asked to vote on the
                  following three proposals:

         1.       A proposal to elect two Class I directors was approved by the
                  shareholders of the Company. The Board of Directors, acting on
                  the recommendation of its Nominating Committee, nominated Dr.
                  Hans-Jurg Schurmann and Jean Head Sisco as Class I directors.
                  There were no other nominations. The result of the vote taken
                  at the Annual Meeting was as follows:

</TABLE>


                  Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast;
                  therefore, votes cast in the election could not be recorded
                  against or as an abstention, nor could a broker non-vote be
                  recorded.

         2.       A proposal to approve an amendment to and restatement of (the
                  "Amendment") the Company's 1996 Equity Compensation Plan was
                  approved by the shareholders of the Company with the following
                  vote:

                  The Amendment provides for an increase in the number of shares
                  of Common Stock authorized under the 1996 Equity Compensation
                  Plan from 450,000 shares to 600,000 shares and allows members
