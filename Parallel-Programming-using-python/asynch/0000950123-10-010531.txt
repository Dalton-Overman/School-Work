    At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote
    upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger
    (&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), dated as of January&#160;8,
    2010, among Hillenbrand, Inc. (&#147;Parent&#148;), Krusher
    Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
    (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), and the Company.

    The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the
    merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company
    as the surviving corporation in the merger (the
    &#147;Merger&#148;). As a result of the Merger, the Company will
    become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is
    completed, you will be entitled to receive $150.00 in cash (as
    may be increased in certain limited circumstances as set forth
    in the Merger Agreement), without interest and less any required
    withholding tax, for each share of our common stock you own at
    the consummation of the Merger, as more fully described in the
    enclosed proxy statement.

    of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote

    The proxy statement attached to this letter provides you with

    may also obtain more information about the Company from
    documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange

    affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast at the special

    entered into a voting agreement with Parent and Merger Sub under
    which they have agreed to vote substantially all of their shares
    of common stock in favor of the approval of the Merger
    Agreement. Collectively, this voting agreement relates to
    approximately 10% of the Company&#146;s outstanding shares of
    common stock.

    Parent expects to use cash on hand and proceeds from debt

    Pursuant to a covenant contained in the Distribution Agreement

    Generally, yes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of
    our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
    transaction for U.S.&#160;federal income tax purposes. In
    general, a U.S.&#160;Holder (as defined in &#147;The
    Merger&#160;&#151; Material U.S.&#160;Federal Income Tax
    Consequences of the Merger to Our Shareholders&#148; on
    page&#160;40) whose shares of Common Stock are converted into
    the right to receive cash in the Merger will recognize capital
    gain or loss for U.S.&#160;federal income tax purposes equal to
    the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with
    respect to such shares (determined before the deduction of any
    applicable withholding taxes) and the shareholder&#146;s
    adjusted tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss generally
    will be long-term capital gain or loss if a
    U.S.&#160;Holder&#146;s holding period for such shares is more
    than one year at the time of the consummation of the Merger.
    Backup withholding may also apply with respect to cash you
    receive in the Merger, unless you provide proof of an applicable
    exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number and
    otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup
    withholding rules.

    This proxy statement and the documents to which we refer you in

    amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). You can identify these
    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
    historical or current facts and are based, at least in part,

    limitation, those relating to future actions, strategies, future
    performance and future financial results. Although we believe
    that the expectations underlying these forward-looking
    statements are reasonable, there are a number of risks and
    uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
    materially from those suggested by the forward-looking
    statements. These forward-looking statements should, therefore,
    be considered in light of various important factors set forth
    from time to time in our filings with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the &#147;SEC.&#148;

    Company serves the bulk solids material handling markets through
    two separate business lines which focus primarily on feeding and
    pneumatic conveying equipment (the &#147;Process Group&#148;)
    and on size reduction equipment, conveying systems and screening
    equipment (the &#147;Size Reduction Group&#148;). The Process
    Group designs, produces, markets, sells and services both feeder
    equipment, which controls the flow of materials into a
    manufacturing process by weight (known as gravimetric feeding)
    or by volume (known as volumetric feeding), and pneumatic
    conveying equipment, which transports bulk solids from one point
    to another point with negative pressure (known as vacuum
    conveying) or with positive pressure (known as pressure
    conveying). The Process Group markets and sells this equipment
    under two main brands: K-Tron Feeders and K-Tron Premier. The
    Size Reduction Group designs, manufactures, markets and sells
    size reduction equipment, such as hammermills, wood hogs and
    double roll crushers. This equipment is used to resize various
    materials to a given smaller size, and the principal industries
    served are the power generation, coal and minerals mining, pulp
    and paper and wood and forest products industries. The Size
    Reduction Group markets and sells this equipment under the
    Pennsylvania Crusher, Gundlach and Jeffrey Rader brands.

    From time to time, K-Tron and the Board of Directors have, with
    their legal and financial advisors, reviewed and evaluated
    strategic opportunities and alternatives with a view to
    enhancing shareholder value. In June 2008, after considering
    proposals and presentations by five financial advisory firms,
    the Board of Directors engaged Goldman, Sachs&#160;&#038; Co.
    (&#147;Goldman Sachs&#148;) to act as its exclusive financial
    advisor in connection with a possible sale of K-Tron. On behalf
    and at the direction of K-Tron, Goldman Sachs reached out to 77
    potential purchasers during the next three months. A number of
    these potential purchasers expressed preliminary interest in
    acquiring K-Tron and 16 potential purchasers executed
    confidentiality agreements with K-Tron. These 16 potential
    purchasers were provided with high-level summary information
    regarding K-Tron and were asked to submit non-binding indicative
    offers. For the reasons described below, all of the potential
    purchasers, other than a private equity sponsor (&#147;Party
    A&#148;), withdrew from the process without submitting an
    indicative offer. On Friday, September&#160;12, 2008, when
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">K-Tron</FONT>
    Common Stock was trading at approximately $150 per share, Party
    A submitted a non-binding indicative offer to acquire K-Tron for
    $165 a share, subject to conducting due diligence, obtaining
    financing and other material conditions. As worldwide economic
    conditions dramatically declined in the next two weeks, Party A
    withdrew from the process, indicating that it could not obtain
    financing.

    Accordingly, in light of rapidly deteriorating worldwide

    The Board of Directors made a number of important observations
    regarding the 2008 managed sale process that were important to
    its consideration of the 2009 opportunity with Parent: first, no
    potential purchaser in 2008 was interested in acquiring both of
    K-Tron&#146;s business lines (the Size Reduction Group and the
    Process Group) at a customary premium to K-Tron&#146;s current
    stock trading price; second, certain of the mining equipment
    companies contacted were interested in acquiring the Size
    Reduction Group, but were not interested in acquiring the
    Process Group; third, certain of the process equipment companies
    contacted were interested in acquiring the Process Group, but
    were not interested in acquiring the Size Reduction Group; and
    fourth, the Board of Directors did not believe there was an
    efficient way to sell the two Groups separately from a tax
    perspective.

    indication of a compelling valuation before it would commit its
    executive management to undertake the substantial additional
    effort required to respond to Parent&#146;s supplemental due

    review of the due diligence materials in the online data room.

    Zerkle, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of
    Parent, and Mr.&#160;Cloues spoke by telephone. During this
    conversation, Mr.&#160;Camp advised Mr.&#160;Cloues that the
    Acquisitions Committee of Parent&#146;s board of directors had
    recently met and given preliminary approval to proceeding with
    the proposed transaction. Mr.&#160;Camp also advised
    Mr.&#160;Cloues that Parent was suggesting a valuation for each
    share of K-Tron Common Stock in the low $140s (also referred to
    by the principals as a &#147;$140 plus value&#148;), which might
    be increased to the mid $140s following diligence, in an
    acquisition made pursuant to a &#147;two-step&#148; merger
    involving an all cash tender offer for the shares of K-Tron
    Common Stock. At this time K-Tron Common Stock was trading at
    approximately $100 per share. Mr.&#160;Camp stated that senior
    management continuity at K-Tron was a critical requirement of
    any potential transaction, and was especially necessary for
    Parent in light of K-Tron representing new product lines for
    Parent. Mr.&#160;Camp also noted that Parent&#146;s valuation
    was subject to further due diligence, negotiation of definitive
    documentation and approval of the board of directors of Parent.
    Mr.&#160;Camp also expressed to Mr.&#160;Cloues that, as a
    condition to Parent continuing to conduct due diligence in
    pursuit of a transaction with K-Tron, K-Tron could not speak to
    any other party regarding a potential strategic transaction and
    that if K-Tron entered into any such discussions, Parent would
    cease working towards a transaction with K-Tron. After this
    Friday conversation, Mr.&#160;Cloues provided a brief summary of
    these developments to the Board of Directors, scheduled a
    meeting of the Board of Directors for the following Monday
    morning, and also discussed these developments with
    representatives of Goldman Sachs.

    the Board of Directors on the status of the discussions with
    Parent. Mr.&#160;Cloues reported that Parent had proposed the
    $140 plus value per share of Common Stock in cash, which might
    be increased following additional due diligence to the mid
    $140s. He also informed the Board of Directors that the proposed
    transaction would be structured as a &#147;two-step&#148; merger
    involving a tender offer. The Board of Directors also considered
    Goldman Sachs&#146; preliminary financial analyses with respect
    to the transaction, which representatives from Goldman Sachs had
    previously discussed with Mr.&#160;Cloues. The Board of
    Directors had a wide-ranging discussion regarding Parent&#146;s
    proposal and advised Mr.&#160;Cloues that the suggested
    valuation was inadequate and did not fully reflect K-Tron&#146;s
    fair value. The Board of Directors directed Mr.&#160;Cloues to
    advise Parent that K-Tron was not interested in proceeding at
    the $140s plus value and to encourage Parent to increase its

    Promptly after this Board of Directors meeting, Mr.&#160;Cloues
    sent Mr.&#160;Camp an email indicating that the Board of
    Directors deemed the proposed $140 plus value per share of
    Common Stock in cash to be below what the Board of Directors
    believed was the fair value of the Company. Mr.&#160;Cloues
    indicated that the Board of Directors was not interested in a
    transaction with Parent unless the shareholders received a
    compelling price, which the Board of Directors believed was in
    the range of $150&#160;-&#160;$160 per share in cash. Further,
    Mr.&#160;Cloues told Mr.&#160;Camp that the Board of Directors
    did not believe that the proposed $140 plus value was compelling
    and was not interested in proceeding with the transaction with
    Parent at this price. Mr.&#160;Cloues expressed his continued
    interest in pursuing a business combination with Parent and
    encouraged Mr.&#160;Camp and Parent to give consideration to a
    higher valuation for K-Tron. Mr.&#160;Camp suggested that $145
    per share would be his &#147;top price,&#148; but after further
    discussions between the executives, each executive agreed to
    explore with his board of directors the viability of a value of
    $150 per share.

    board of directors of Parent was increasing its valuation to
    $150 per share in cash, subject to certain conditions, including
    that K-Tron not speak to any other party regarding a potential
    strategic transaction, further due diligence and the importance
    of continuity of senior management. During this call,

    2009, representatives from K-Tron and Parent, along with their
    respective financial and legal advisors, determined to proceed
    with the transaction using a &#147;one-step&#148; merger
    structure that was expected to close in late March 2010
    (compared to the earlier closing, late January 2010, expected
    with the &#147;two-step&#148; merger involving a tender offer).
    As was the case with the &#147;two-step&#148; transaction, there
    would not be a financing condition.

    On Wednesday, December&#160;23, 2009, Mr.&#160;Cloues sent an
    email to the Board of Directors detailing the discussions with

    his prior email communication to the Board of Directors with
    some background material and a summary of Parent&#146;s leverage
    ratio issue prepared by Morgan Lewis. On December&#160;23, 2009,
    Skadden Arps distributed a revised draft of the merger agreement
    reflecting the change from a &#147;two-step&#148; merger
    involving a tender offer to a &#147;one-step&#148; merger

    On Thursday, December&#160;24, 2009, Mr.&#160;Cloues emailed
    Mr.&#160;Camp to raise several questions regarding Parent&#146;s
    compliance with the leverage ratio under the Distribution
    Agreement and to request further deal protections in the merger
    agreement in light of the new structure of the transaction,
    including Parent&#146;s commitment to consummate a debt or
    equity financing in the event that Parent did not have
    sufficient funds to consummate the transaction and,
    additionally, an increase in the price per share for any delay
    in closing caused by Parent&#146;s failure to have sufficient
    funds to consummate the transaction. Between December&#160;18,
    2009 and December&#160;30, 2009, several email communications
    were exchanged between K-Tron and its financial and legal
    advisors and Parent and its financial and legal advisors. The
    communications included details regarding enforcement of
    Parent&#146;s obligation to finance the transaction and due
    diligence responses from Parent regarding the availability of
    sources to fund the anticipated closing of the proposed
    transaction in late March 2010.

    On Tuesday, December&#160;29, 2009, Skadden Arps distributed a
    revised draft of the tender and support agreement (now a voting
    agreement), which had been modified to reflect the
    &#147;one-step&#148; merger transaction structure. Pursuant to
    the terms of the voting agreement, the executive officers and
    members of the Board of Directors would be asked to agree to
    vote their shares in favor of the approval of the merger

    Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior
    management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past
    and current business operations, financial condition and future
    prospects of the Company. In addition, Goldman Sachs reviewed
    the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Common
    Stock, compared certain financial and stock market information
    for the Company with similar information for certain other
    companies the securities of which are publicly traded, reviewed
    the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
    the crushing and process handling industries specifically and in

    For purposes of rendering the opinion described above, Goldman
    Sachs relied upon and assumed, without assuming any
    responsibility for independent verification, the accuracy and
    completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax,
    accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or
    reviewed by Goldman Sachs, and Goldman Sachs does not assume any
    liability for any such information. In that regard, Goldman
    Sachs assumed with the Company&#146;s Board of Directors&#146;
    consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a
    basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
    judgments of the management of the Company. In addition, Goldman
    Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the
    assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or
    off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any
    of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any
    such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all
    governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
    necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
    without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
    Merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs&#146; analysis.
    Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger will be consummated
    on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the
    waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of
    which would be in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs&#146;
    analysis. Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the
    impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company
    or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay its
    obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs&#146; opinion did
    not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters,
    nor did it address the underlying business decision of the
    Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the
    Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be
    available to the Company. Since the termination by the Company
    of its review of potential strategic alternatives in September
    2008, Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not
    solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an
    acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company
    or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs&#146;
    opinion addressed only the fairness from a financial point of
    view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $150.00 per share in
    cash to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its
    affiliates) of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
    Agreement. Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its
    opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger
    Agreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other
    agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
    entered into or amended in connection with the Merger,
    including, without limitation, the fairness of the Merger to, or
    any consideration received in connection therewith by, the
    holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
    constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the
    amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to
    any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or
    class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether
    relative to the $150.00 per share in cash to be paid to the
    holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of
    Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.
    Goldman Sachs&#146; opinion was necessarily based on economic,
    monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
    information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of
    the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes no responsibility for
    updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on
    circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date
    of its opinion. Goldman Sachs&#146; advisory services and the
    opinion of Goldman Sachs were provided for the information and
    assistance of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors in
    connection with its consideration of the Merger and such opinion
    does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of
    shares of Common Stock should vote with respect to the Merger or
    any other matter. Goldman Sachs&#146; opinion was approved by a

    value of unlevered free cash flows for the Company for the years
    2010 through 2014 using discount rates ranging from 11.0% to
    13.0%, reflecting estimates of the Company&#146;s weighted
    average cost of capital. Illustrative terminal values were
    calculated using perpetuity free cash flow growth rates ranging
    from 3.0% to 5.0%. These illustrative terminal values were then
    discounted to calculate implied indications of the present
    values of these illustrative terminal values using discount
    rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%. This analysis resulted in a

    <I>Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price
    Analysis.</I>&#160;&#160;Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative
    analysis of the implied present value of the future price per

    value of a theoretical future value of a company&#146;s equity
    as a function of such company&#146;s estimated future earnings
    and its assumed price to future earnings multiples. For this
    analysis, Goldman Sachs used the earnings reflected in the
    Forecasts for the calendar years 2011 through 2014. Goldman
    Sachs calculated the implied present values per share by
    applying price to forward earnings per share multiples ranging
    from 14.0x to 16.0x to estimated earnings per share for the
    calendar years 2011 through 2014, and then discounted the
    resulting values to present value using a discount rate of
    12.3%, reflecting an estimate of the Company&#146;s cost of
    equity. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present
    values per share of $104.79 to $144.06.

    <I>Illustrative Leveraged Buyout
    Analysis.</I>&#160;&#160;Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative
    leveraged buyout analysis for the Company using publicly

    performing the illustrative leveraged buyout analysis, Goldman
    Sachs assumed a hypothetical financial buyer purchase price per
    share of $120 and total debt to EBITDA multiples ranging from
    4.0x to 5.0x. This analysis was based on a range of illustrative
    trailing exit EBITDA multiples of 7.5x to 9.5x for the assumed
    exit at the end of 2014. The analysis resulted in illustrative
    internal rate of equity returns to a hypothetical buyer ranging
    from 21.0% to 30.9%.

    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and
    is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
    description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
    summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a
    whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
    underlying Goldman Sachs&#146; opinion. In arriving at its
    fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of
    all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight
    to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman
    Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
    experience and professional judgment after considering the
    results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used
    in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to
    the Company, Parent or the Merger.

    Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman
    Sachs&#146; providing its opinion to the Company&#146;s Board of
    Directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view to
    the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of
    Common Stock of the $150.00 per share in cash to be paid to such

    Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
    necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
    significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these
    analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to
    uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond
    the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of
    the Company, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes

    banking and financial advisory services, commercial banking,
    securities trading, investment management, principal investment,
    financial planning, benefits counseling, risk management,
    hedging, financing, brokerage activities and other financial and
    non-financial activities and services for various persons and

    actively trade or effect transactions, in the equity, debt and
    other securities (or related derivative securities) and
    financial instruments (including bank loans and other

    their respective affiliates or any currency or commodity that
    may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Merger
    Agreement for their own account and for the accounts of their
    customers. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the
    Company in connection with, and participated in certain of the
    negotiations leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided
    certain investment banking and other financial services to
    Parent and its affiliates from time to time, including having
    acted as co-financial advisor to Hillenbrand Industries Inc.,
    now known as Hill-Rom Holdings Inc. (&#147;Hill-Rom&#148;), in
    connection with the spin-off of Batesville Holdings Inc., now

    The Company&#146;s Board of Directors selected Goldman Sachs as
    its financial advisor because it is an internationally
    recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
    experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a
    letter agreement, dated June&#160;13, 2008, the Company engaged
    Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with
    the Merger. Pursuant to the terms of this engagement letter, the
    Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of
    approximately $5&#160;million, the principal portion of which is
    contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, the
    Company has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its expenses,
    including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements, and to
    indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various
    liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal
    securities laws.

    We do not, as a matter of course, make public forecasts or
    projections as to future performance or financial performance
    and are especially wary of making projections for extended
    earnings periods due to the inherent unpredictability of the
    underlying assumptions and estimates. In the course of the
    process resulting in the Merger Agreement, management of the
    Company prepared non-public financial projections, which
    projections were based on management&#146;s estimate of the
    Company&#146;s future financial performance as of the date they
    were prepared (the &#147;Forecasts&#148;). The Forecasts, which
    were prepared in November 2009, included projected revenues,
    EBITDA, EBIT, net income and EPS for the years 2009 through
    2014. The Forecasts for 2009 were based on actual results for
    the first three fiscal quarters of the year, and projected
    results for the fourth fiscal quarter of the year. The Forecasts
    were provided by the management of the Company to the Board of
    Directors and Goldman Sachs. The Forecasts (other than projected
    net income and EPS) were also provided to Parent. The Company
    approved the use by Goldman Sachs of the Forecasts in connection
    with Goldman Sachs&#146; financial analyses of the proposed
    transaction and its opinion dated January&#160;8, 2010 that, as
    of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and
    assumptions set forth therein, the $150.00 per share in cash to
    be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of
    shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair
    from a financial point of view to such holders. Consistent with
    K-Tron&#146;s prior practice, the Forecasts did not include the
    effects of any potential future acquisitions by K-Tron. At
    Parent&#146;s request, the Company&#146;s management prepared
    and provided to Parent and Goldman Sachs, certain additional
    projected financial information relating to potential future
    acquisitions by the Company. The Company did not authorize
    Goldman Sachs to use such additional projected financial
    information in connection with Goldman Sachs&#146; financial
    analyses of the proposed transaction or its opinion.

    Regarding Forward-Looking Information&#148; and the risk factors
    referred to therein. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that

    those contained in the Forecasts. The Company does not intend to
    make publicly available any update or other revisions to the

    If the Merger Agreement is approved by our shareholders and the
    other conditions to the completion of the Merger are either
    satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
    Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving
    corporation. Upon the completion of the Merger, each issued and
    outstanding share of Common Stock, except for shares owned
    directly or indirectly by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub (in
    each case, other than any such shares held on behalf of third
    parties), will be cancelled and converted automatically into the
    right to receive the Merger Consideration. Our shareholders will
    be required to surrender their shares of Common Stock upon the
    completion of the Merger in exchange for such cash payments and
    will not own any shares of the surviving corporation or Parent
    as a result of surrendering such shares of Common Stock. After
    completion of the Merger, shareholders will not have the
    opportunity to liquidate their shares at a time and for a price
    of their own choosing. If all eligible shares are converted, the
    total Merger Consideration (excluding consideration to be paid
    to holders of options, unvested restricted stock and restricted
    stock units) expected to be paid is approximately
    $422,052,450&#160;million.

    cancelled and exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product
    of (a)&#160;the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration over
    the exercise price per share or right and (b)&#160;the number of
    shares of Common Stock or rights subject to such option or stock

    <I>Exchange of Common Stock for Cash.</I>&#160;&#160;Generally,
    the Merger will be taxable to U.S.&#160;Holders of our Common
    Stock for U.S.&#160;federal income tax purposes. A
    U.S.&#160;Holder of our Common Stock receiving cash in the
    Merger generally will recognize gain or loss for
    U.S.&#160;federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
    difference between the amount of cash received and the
    U.S.&#160;Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in our Common Stock
    surrendered. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital
    gain or loss if our Common Stock is held as a capital asset at
    the effective time of the Merger. Any capital gain or loss will
    be taxed as long-term capital gain or loss if the
    U.S.&#160;Holder has held our Common Stock for more than one
    year prior to the effective time of the Merger. If the
    U.S.&#160;Holder has held our Common Stock for one year or less
    prior to the effective time of the Merger, any capital gain or
    loss will be taxed as short-term capital gain or loss.
    Currently, most long-term capital gains for non-corporate
    taxpayers are taxed at a maximum federal tax rate of 15%. The
    deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain
    limitations. If a U.S.&#160;Holder acquired different blocks of
    our Common Stock at different times and different prices, such
    holder must determine the adjusted tax basis and holding period
    separately with respect to each such block of our Common Stock.

    <I>Information Reporting and Backup
    Withholding.</I>&#160;&#160;Generally, U.S.&#160;Holders of our
    Common Stock will be subject to information reporting on the
    cash received in the Merger unless such a holder is a
    corporation or other exempt recipient. In addition, under the
    U.S.&#160;federal backup withholding tax rules, the paying agent
    will be required to withhold 28% of all cash payments to which a
    holder of Common Stock is entitled in connection with the Merger
    unless such holder provides under penalties of perjury on a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;W-9</FONT>
    (or appropriate substitute form) a tax identification number,
    certifies that such holder is a U.S.&#160;person and that the
    tax identification number is correct and that no backup
    withholding is otherwise required, and otherwise complies with
    such backup withholding rules. Each U.S.&#160;Holder of our
    Common Stock should complete and sign the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;W-9</FONT>
    (or appropriate substitute form) included as part of the letter
    of transmittal and return it to the paying agent, in order to
    certify that the U.S.&#160;Holder is exempt from backup
    withholding or to provide the necessary information to avoid
    backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
    Any amount withheld from a payment to a U.S.&#160;Holder of
    Common Stock under these rules will be allowed as a credit
    against such holder&#146;s U.S.&#160;federal income tax
    liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that
    the required information is furnished timely to the IRS.

    The NJBCA provides that in some mergers involving a New Jersey
    corporation, a shareholder who complies with statutory
    requirements has the right to receive, instead of the merger
    consideration, cash for each of the shareholder&#146;s shares in
    an amount equal to the fair value of each share as of the day
    prior to the shareholder meeting approving the merger. If the
    corporation and the shareholder are unable to agree upon the
    fair value of the shares, then the fair value will be appraised
    by the New Jersey Superior Court. However, this right to
    appraisal is not available under the NJBCA to holders of
    K-Tron&#146;s Common Stock in connection with the Merger.
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Section&#160;14A:11-1</FONT>
    of the NJBCA provides that shareholders do not have a right to
    dissent from any plan of merger or consolidation with respect to
    shares (1)&#160;of a class or series which is listed on a
    national securities exchange or is held of record by not less
    than 1,000 holders or (2)&#160;for which, pursuant to the plan
    of merger or consolidation, such shareholder will receive
    (a)&#160;cash, (b)&#160;shares, obligations or other securities
    which, upon consummation of the merger or consolidation, will
    either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of
    record by not less than 1,000 holders or (c)&#160;cash and such
    securities. Accordingly, K-Tron shareholders will not be
    entitled to exercise any such dissenters&#146; rights of
    appraisal in connection with the transactions contemplated by
    the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is approved and
    the Merger is completed, holders of K-Tron&#146;s Common Stock
    who voted against the approval of the Merger Agreement will be
    treated the same as shareholders who voted for the approval of
    the Merger Agreement and their shares will converted
    automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
