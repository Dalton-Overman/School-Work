         The undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints each of Alan R.
Sukoneck, Vice President of K-Tron International, Inc. (the "Company"), and Mary
E. Vaccara, Secretary of the Company, each having the power to act singly, as
his/her true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

                  (1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
         undersigned's capacity as a director or executive officer of the
         Company, as applicable, Forms 3, 4 or 5 in accordance with Section
         16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
         thereunder;

                  (2) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
         undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete the
         execution of any such Form 3, 4, or 5 and the timely filing of such
         form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and any
         other authority; and

                  (3) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection
         with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may
         be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
         undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
         attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of
         Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and
         conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in his/her discretion.

         The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary and proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or his/her
substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of
this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted. The undersigned
acknowledges that each of the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such
capacity at the request of the undersigned, is not assuming any of the
undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

         This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked in writing.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Power of Attorney
on the 15th day of November, 2002.
