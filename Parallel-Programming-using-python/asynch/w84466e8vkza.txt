                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Shareholders
Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation:

We have audited the 2002 financial statements of Pennsylvania Crusher
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) as listed in the accompanying index. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. The 2001 and 2000 financial statements of Pennsylvania Crusher
Corporation as listed in the accompanying index were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on
those financial statements in their report dated January 17, 2002.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Pennsylvania Crusher
Corporation as of December 31, 2002, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                        PENNSYLVANIA CRUSHER CORPORATION

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000

(1)   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

      Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation (PCC) is a manufacturer of crushing and
      feeding equipment and replacement parts, with locations in Pennsylvania,
      Ohio, and South Carolina. The sales base is both domestic and
      international.

(2)   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      (a)   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

            The financial statements include the accounts of PCC and Jeffrey
            Specialty Equipment, Inc. (Jeffrey), its wholly owned subsidiary
            (the Company). All significant intercompany accounts and
            transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

      (b)   USE OF ESTIMATES

            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
            America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
            affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure
            of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
            statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
            the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
            estimates.

      (c)   REVENUE RECOGNITION

            Sales are recorded upon transfer of title, which occurs upon
            shipment of goods. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping
            and handling are recorded in revenues, with the corresponding
            shipping and handling costs recorded in cost of sales.

            The Company, as part of normal business practice, offers warranties
            on products sold to its customers. These warranties vary in length
            and amount. The Company estimates the exposure related to warranties
            based on experience. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the warranty
            reserve was $553,515 and $423,547, respectively, and is included as
            part of accrued expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2002,
            2001, and 2000, warranty expense was $267,000, $346,615, and
            $450,750, respectively.

      (d)   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

            A majority of the Company's accounts receivable and a substantial
            portion of the Company's revenues are attributable to worldwide
            electric utility companies and independent power producers.

      (e)   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            The Company considers cash and overnight or highly liquid
            investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
            cash equivalents for the purpose of reporting cash flows. As of
            December 31, 2002, the Company had restricted cash of $719,488
            representing advances from selected customers.

            The Company utilizes the lower of cost, determined by the last-in,
            first-out (LIFO) method, or market for determining inventory values.
            Excess and obsolete inventories are written down to net realizable
            values. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
            write-downs of inventory were $161,188, $117,963, and $86,508,
            respectively. All inventory write-downs were included in cost of
            sales.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000

            For income tax purposes, depreciation is provided for using the
            modified accelerated cost recovery method and other methods required
            by federal tax law.

            Expenditures for property improvements, renewals, and betterments
            are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as
            incurred.

      (h)   IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

            Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or
            changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
            asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by
            comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated
            undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
            asset. If an asset is considered impaired, then the impairment loss
            to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset's
            carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Management believes that
            there were no long-lived assets that were impaired as of December
            31, 2002 or 2001. Accordingly, there were no adjustments to carrying
            values of fixed assets as of December 31, 2002 or 2001.

      (i)   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

            In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146,
            Accounting for Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.
            SFAS No. 146 addresses the accounting for costs associated with
            disposal activities covered by SFAS No. 144 and with exit
            (restructuring) activities previously covered by Emerging Issues
            Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
            Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.
            SFAS No. 146 nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3 in its entirety and
            requires that a liability for all costs be recognized when the
            liability is incurred. The ability to accrue in advance for an
            entire restructuring plan is eliminated. Also, the timing of the
            accrual under SFAS No. 146 will depend upon the remaining service
            life of impacted employees. SFAS No. 146 will be applied
            prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after
            December 31, 2002.

(3)   RELATED PARTIES

      In March 1999, the Company formed PCC Partners LP (the Partnership) and
      contributed $5,000,000 of cash and marketable securities to the
      Partnership. Immediately thereafter, the Company distributed 100% of the
      investment in the Partnership to the shareholders of the Company. In
      October 1999, the Partnership loaned the Company $2,000,000. The loan was
      paid off in entirety during 2000.

      A member of the Company's board of directors was employed by a law firm
      that provided legal services to the Company in 2002. The Company incurred
      approximately $215,000, $4,500, and $14,500 of expenses for these legal
      services in 2002, 2001, and 2000, which is included in selling, general,
      and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The
      Company owed this firm $130,000 as of December 31, 2002, which is included
      in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

</TABLE>

            The Company utilized the majority of the proceeds of debt to finance
            the acquisition of Jeffrey in 1999. The remainder of the issuance
            was maintained as a restricted investment. The amount was restricted
            for capital improvements to the Jeffrey facility. The Company was
            required to make approximately $600,000 of capital improvements,
            within 18 months of the acquisition date, to maintain the right to
            any interest earned on the restricted investment. The Company met
            the capital improvement requirement.

            The Company was required to meet certain financial covenants under
            the terms of the debt agreement, including certain ratios of working
            capital, debt coverage, and leverage, which were measured at the end
            of each fiscal year. The Company was in compliance with these
            covenants for the year ended December 31, 2001.

            On December 23, 2002, the Company paid off the remaining amount of
            the debt. The Company incurred financing costs related to the bond
            issuance in 1999, and had deferred them over a five-year period.
            With the repayment of the outstanding debt balance, the Company
            expensed $38,500 related to the remaining deferred financing costs
            in 2002.

      (5)   INCOME TAXES

            Effective January 1, 1988, the Company elected S Corporation status
            for federal and state purposes. As such, the Company will incur no
            tax liability; however, the earnings of the Company will be taxable
            to the shareholders. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been
            reflected in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company has made
            distributions during 2002, 2001, and 2000 to the shareholders to
            fund their tax liabilities related to the S Corporation earnings. As
            a result of the acquisition of the Company in 2003 (note 9), no
            additional distributions will be made.

            The tax basis of the assets and liabilities at December 31, 2002,
            2001, and 2000 exceeded their financial reporting basis by
            approximately $1,000,000, $1,200,000, and $1,300,000, respectively.


                                       10                            (Continued)

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000

            During the year, the Company recognized $174,158 of income related
            to the reduction of a tax liability which is no longer required. The
            amount is included in other income on the consolidated statement of
            income.

      (6)   COMMON STOCK

            The Company's authorized shares consist of 50,000 Class A common
            voting shares and 50,000 Class B Common nonvoting shares, which are
            identical in all respects, except that the Class B shares do not
            carry voting rights. On October 18, 1990, the Company entered into
            an Exchange Agreement (Agreement) with its shareholders. Under the
            Agreement, three of the Company's shareholders exchanged all of
            their common stock for an equal number of Class B common nonvoting
            shares, and one of the Company's shareholders exchanged all of his
            common stock for an equal number of Class A common voting shares.
            Effective October 25, 2000, under the terms of the Agreement, the
            nonvoting shareholders elected to exchange each Class B share for an
            equivalent number of Class A shares. In June 2002, the Company
            purchased 2,800 shares from the shareholders for $2,013,620.

      (7)   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

            The Company has a 401(k) defined contribution plan for all
            employees. Total contributions were $317,949, $299,165, and $520,444
            for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

            On December 31, 2002, $1,000,000 was paid to an executive under a
            contribution and release agreement associated with the acquisition
            of the Company (note 9). This payment is included in selling,
            general, and administrative expense for 2002.

      (8)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

            The Company leases its Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio plant and its Broomall,
            Pennsylvania office space. The lease terms are through January 31,
            2005, and are accounted for as operating leases. Minimum annual
            rentals on these facilities are as follows:

            Rent expense was $355,763, $355,763, and $358,712 in 2002, 2001, and
            2000, respectively.

            The Company has an agreement with its shareholders that requires the
            Company to purchase, at book value, shares held by a shareholder who
            wishes to sell all shares held, or who dies, is disabled, or
            terminates employment. Additionally, if a shareholder's employment
            is terminated by the board of directors without cause, and certain
            "additional payment events," as defined in the agreement, occur
            within one year of the termination, the Company is required to pay
            the terminated shareholder an additional amount, as defined in the
            agreement, for the shares purchased. This agreement was terminated
            as a result of the acquisition of the Company (note 9).

      (9)   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

            On January 2, 2003, the board of directors of the Company entered
            into an agreement to sell all of the stock of Pennsylvania Crusher
            Corporation and its subsidiary, Jeffrey Specialty Equipment, Inc.,

            payable in equal, annual installments on January 2 in each of 2005,
            2006, and 2007. The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on
            the Company's consolidated shareholders' equity at December 31,
            2002.

      The K-Tron subsidiary's borrowing was part of a larger, secured term loan.
      Monthly principal payments of $83 thousand and interest payments computed
      at a fixed rate of 5.625% on approximately half the loan and a variable
      rate of one month LIBOR plus 1.85% on the other half (3.27% at December
      28, 2002) began February 2003, with the final principal payment of $2.4
      million plus interest due January 2008.

      The PCC borrowing of $15 million has two tranches of term debt ($10
      million with a five-year term and $3.5 million with a six-year term) and
      $1.5 million under a five-year revolving credit facility with an
      additional $2 million of availability subject to certain conditions.
      Quarterly term debt principal payments of $400 thousand begin March 31,
      2003 and increase each year by $62.5 thousand per quarter (or $250
