                                POWER OF ATTORNEY


         The undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints each of Edward B.
Cloues, II and Mary E. Vaccara, or either of them signing singly, as his true
and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

         (1)      execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
                  undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director of K-Tron
                  International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"),
                  Forms 3, 4 or 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the
                  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
                  thereunder;

         (2)      do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
                  undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete
                  the execution of any such Form 3, 4, or 5 and the timely
                  filing of such form with the United States Securities and
                  Exchange Commission and any other authority; and

         (3)      take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection
                  with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such
                  attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest
                  of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
                  understood that the documents executed by such
                  attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this
                  Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such
                  terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in
                  his or her discretion.

         The undersigned hereby grants to such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary
and proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein
granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as such attorney-in-fact might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or his or her
substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of
this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted. The undersigned
acknowledges that the foregoing attorney-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at
the request of the undersigned, is not assuming any of the undersigned's
responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

         This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked in writing.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Power of Attorney
on the 6 day of November, 2008.
