                    K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC. & SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  APRIL 4, 1998
                                   (Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
been made. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 1998 which
was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash paid in the first
three months of 1998 and 1997 for interest was $.2 million and $.2 million,
respectively, and for income taxes was $.3 million and $.7 million,
respectively.

3. Earnings per Share

In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128
requires that the Company report Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share. Basic
Earnings Per Share represents net income less preferred dividends divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted Earnings Per Share is
calculated similarly, except that the denominator includes weighted average
common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of options, warrants,
convertible securities and other instruments with dilutive effects if exercised.

The Company's Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share are calculated as follows:

Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common and
common equivalent shares outstanding during each year. Such average shares
include the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options after the assumed repurchase of common
shares with the related proceeds.

4. Impact of New Accounting Pronouncement

In the first quarter, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which establishes standards
for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components.
Comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes
in equity. For the 3 months in the period ended April 4, 1998 and March 29,
1997, the following table sets forth the Company=s comprehensive income as
follows:

                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

         For the first three months of 1998 and 1997, the Company reported net
income of $1,307,000 and $1,050,000, respectively.

         K-Tron is an international company with approximately 59% of its
revenues derived from products manufactured and services performed from its
facilities outside the United States, primarily in Europe. As such, the
financial position and performance of the Company is sensitive to both
translation and transaction fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
("foreign exchange rates").

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

         Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of operations
into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly
with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark. In addition, revenues and
income of the Company with respect to particular transactions may be affected by
changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in other currencies,
including in particular the average U.S.

dollar/ Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark and Deutsche mark/Swiss franc
exchange rates. For the first three months of 1998 as well as the same period in
1997, the changes in these exchange rates were as follows:

         Total revenues increased by $.1 million or less than 1% in the first
three months of 1998 when compared to the same period in 1997. The increase in
revenues would have been greater except for the lower exchange translation rates
of certain currencies into U.S. dollars. If the average foreign exchange
translation rates for the first three months of 1998 were applied to the same
periods in 1997, revenues would have increased 3.0% for the first three months.

         Gross profit as a percent of revenues improved to 44.9% for the first
three months of 1998, as compared to 43.9% for the same period in 1997. The
change in gross margin in 1998 was primarily due to sales mix and increased
volume in local currencies.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $.1
million or 1.5% for the first three months of 1998, as compared to the same
period in 1997. The decrease in SG&A was due to the lower foreign exchange
translation rates previously described offset in part by higher selling
expenses.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures increased slightly for the
first three months of 1998, as compared to the same period in 1997. R&D expenses
increased due to the development of new product enhancements, offset in part by
lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         Interest expense decreased by $.1 million or 33.8% for the first three
months of 1998, as compared to the same period in 1997, primarily due to lower
debt levels and lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         The effective tax rate for the first three months of 1998 was 29.0%,
compared to 23.1% for the same period in 1997. The effective tax rate in the
first three months of 1998 was higher than the same period in 1997 due to an
increase in income in the United States.

         The March 1998 backlog increased by 22.1%, primarily in Europe, when
compared to December 1997 and increased slightly when compared to the same
period in 1997 (at constant foreign exchange rates).

         At January 3, 1998, the Company=s Swiss subsidiary achieved better than
a 1.5 to 1.0 debt to equity ratio and, accordingly, on March 31, 1998 the 2%
interest premium on borrowed funds terminated and certain other restrictions
ended. Moreover, the Swiss subsidiary and the Swiss lenders terminated the
forbearance agreement on March 31, 1998. New lines of credit arrangements have
either been entered into or agreed to in principal with the Swiss lenders for
8.0 million Swiss francs ($5.2 million). As of April 4, 1998, 2.0 million Swiss
francs ($1.3 million) was outstanding under these agreements at an interest rate
of 3.75%.

         Total debt decreased by $1.5 million in the first three months of 1998,
of which $.6 million was due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.
Total debt without the effect of the foreign exchange translation decreased by
$.9 million. European and U.S. debt decreased by $.7 million and $.2 million,
respectively. At April 4, 1998, the Company had $5.7 million of availability
under its U.S. revolving credit agreement and $3.9 million of availability under
its new Swiss loan arrangements.

         At April 4, 1998, there was working capital of $10.7 million as
compared to $9.4 million at January 3, 1998, and the ratio of current assets to
current liabilities at those dates was 1.50 and 1.41, respectively.

         In the first three months of 1998 and 1997, the Company utilized
earnings from operations and internally-generated funds to meet its working
capital needs and reduce debt.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $.3 million in the first
three months of 1998 as compared to $3.5 million in the same period of 1997. The
decrease in operating cash flow was primarily from an increase in accounts
receivable and inventories and a decrease in the total amount of accounts
payable and accrued expenses.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first three months of 1998
and 1997 was for capital additions.

         Net cash used in financing activities in the first three months of 1998
and 1997 was for the reduction of debt and was obtained from the cash provided
by operating activities.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease in
shareholders' equity of $.5 million in the first three months of 1998.
