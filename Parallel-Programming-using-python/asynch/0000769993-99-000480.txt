   (1) As of May 7, 1999, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. was merged with and into
The  Goldman  Sachs  Group,  Inc. ("GS Group"), with  GS Group  as the surviving
entity.

  (2) In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission  ("SEC") Release No.
34-39538  (January 12,  1998),  this filing  reflects the fact that GS Group and
Goldman,  Sachs & Co.  ("Goldman  Sachs") will no longer  report the  beneficial
ownership of the securities  beneficially owned by the asset management division
of  Goldman  Sachs  (the  "Asset  Management  Division").  The Asset  Management
Division  will  separately  report,  to  the  extent  required,  its  beneficial
ownership of securities.

   (3) GS Group  and  Goldman Sachs each  disclaim beneficial  ownership of  the
securities  beneficially  owned by (i) any client accounts with respect to which
Goldman   Sachs  or  employees  of  Goldman  Sachs  have  voting  or  investment
discretion,  or both and (ii) certain investment entities, of which a subsidiary
of GS Group or Goldman Sachs is the general partner, managing general partner or
other  manager,  to the extent  interests  in such  entities are held by persons
