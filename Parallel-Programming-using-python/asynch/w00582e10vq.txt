                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  July 3, 2004
                                   (Unaudited)

1.    Basis of Presentation

      The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not
      include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete
      financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the
      accounts of K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("K-Tron" or
      the "Company"). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
      consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
      of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation
      of results for interim periods have been made.

      Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year's consolidated
      financial statements to conform them to the current period presentation.

      The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction
      with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January
      3, 2004 which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission.

2.    New Accounting Pronouncements

      In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
      Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). In general, a variable interest
      entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure
      used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors
      with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide
      sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities.
      FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by
      the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the
      characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have
      sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
      additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The
      consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable
      interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The adoption of the
      provisions of FIN 46 effective February 1, 2003 did not have a material
      impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements since the
      Company currently does not have any variable interest entities. In
      December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R with respect to variable interest
      entities created before January 31, 2003 which, among other things,
      revised the implementation date to the first fiscal year or interim period
      ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of Special Purpose
      Entities ("SPEs"). The consolidation requirements apply to all SPEs in the
      first fiscal year or interim period ending after December 15, 2003. The
      Company's adoption of the provisions of FIN 46R effective January 3, 2004
      did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
      statements since the Company currently does not have any SPEs, nor does it
      have any variable interest entities.

8.    Earnings Per Share

      The Company previously adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", which
      requires that the Company report Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share.
      Basic Earnings Per Share represents net income less preferred dividends
      divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
      Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated similarly, except that the
      denominator includes the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding plus the dilutive effect of options, warrants, convertible
      securities and other instruments with dilutive effects if exercised.

      The Company's Diluted Earnings Per Share shown in the table below are
      based on the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
      shares outstanding during a given time period. Such average shares include
      the weighted average number of

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

      common shares outstanding plus the shares issuable upon exercise of stock
      options after the assumed repurchase of common shares with the related
      proceeds.

      The Company's Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share are calculated as
      follows:

9.    Stock-Based Compensation

      As permitted under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation", as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation - Transition and Disclosure", the Company has elected to
      continue to account for compensation cost using the intrinsic value-based
      method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
      Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". SFAS No. 123
      requires the Company to disclose pro forma net income and pro forma
      earnings per share amounts, as if compensation expense were recognized for
      options granted after fiscal year 1994. Using this approach, net income
      and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
      indicated in the following table:

      This pro forma impact may not be representative of the effects for future
      years, and could increase if additional options are granted and amortized
      over the vesting period. For disclosure purposes, the fair value of each
      stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
      Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
      assumptions: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 31.45% and 30.80%;
      risk-free interest rate of 4.15% and 2.76%; and expected life of 6.00
      years and 6.00 years for grants in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

      The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating
      the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
      fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the input
      of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.

10.   Comprehensive Income

      Comprehensive income is the total of net income, the change in the
      unrealized gain or loss on the Company's interest rate swap, net of tax,
      and the change in foreign currency translation adjustments, all for a
      given period, which are the Company's only non-owner changes in equity.
      For the three and six-month periods ending July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003,
      the following table sets forth the Company's comprehensive income:

11.   Management Segment Information

      The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About
      Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS No. 131
      introduced a model for segment reporting called the management approach.
      The management approach is based on the way that the chief operating
      decision-maker organizes segments within a company for making operating
      decisions and assessing performance. The Company is engaged in one
      business segment, material handling equipment and systems. The Company
      operates in two primary geographic locations, North and South America (the
      "Americas") and Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia ("EMEA/Asia").

      For the three and six months ended July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, the
      following table sets forth the Company's geographic information:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

INTRODUCTION

      We are engaged in one principal business segment - material handling
equipment and systems. We operate in two primary geographic locations - North
and South America (the "Americas") and Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia
("EMEA/Asia").

      We have three main business lines within the material handling equipment
and systems segment. They are our feeding, size reduction and pneumatic
conveying business lines.

      The following provides information that management believes is relevant to
an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and
financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. All references in this
Item 2 to the second quarter or first six months of 2004 or 2003 mean the fiscal
quarter or six-month period ended July 3, 2004 or June 28, 2003, as the case may
be.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

      Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in
our 2003 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and included as part of our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended January 3, 2004 (the "2003 Form 10-K"). The preparation of
those financial statements required management to make estimates and assumptions
that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

      The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 2
to the 2003 consolidated financial statements, and the critical accounting
policies and estimates are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis
included in our 2003 Form 10-K. Information concerning our implementation and
the impact of new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) is included in the notes to the 2003 consolidated
financial statements. We did not adopt an accounting policy in the first six
months of 2004 that had a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

      For the second quarter and first six months of 2004, we reported revenues
of $27,062,000 and $53,383,000 and net income of $1,389,000 and $2,811,000,
respectively, compared to revenues of $22,661,000 and $46,059,000 and net income
of $865,000 and $1,700,000 for the same periods in 2003. The increases in second
quarter and first six months of 2004 revenues and net income compared with the
same periods in 2003 were primarily the result of improved business conditions
in all three of our main business lines, and also reflected the positive effect
of a weaker U.S. dollar when translating the revenues and profits of our foreign
operations into U.S. dollars. First six months of 2004 net income also benefited
from the profit contribution from the first quarter sale of an office building
by one of our United Kingdom subsidiaries.

Foreign Exchange Rates

      We are an international company, and we derived 44% and 43% of our
revenues for the first six months of 2004 and 2003, respectively, from products
manufactured in, and services performed from, our facilities located outside the
United States, primarily in Europe. Since we operate globally, we are sensitive
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange rates"), which
can affect both the translation of financial statement items into U.S. dollars
as well as transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be
accounted for in different currencies, such as sales made from our Swiss
manufacturing facility in currencies other than the Swiss franc.

      Since we have received substantial revenues in recent years from
activities in foreign jurisdictions, our results can be significantly affected
by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in U.S. dollar exchange rates
with respect to the Swiss franc, euro and British pound sterling and, to a
lesser degree, the Singapore dollar and other currencies. When the U.S. dollar
weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based
sales increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. Correspondingly, the
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar
weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, our revenues in
U.S. dollars generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected
by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide, especially those
identified above. In particular, a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against
other currencies would positively affect our revenues, gross profit and
operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars (provided that the gross profit
and operating income numbers from foreign operations are not losses, since in
the case of a loss, the effect would be to increase the loss), whereas a general
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such currencies would have the opposite
effect. In addition, our revenues and income with respect to particular
transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales
are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility
manufacturing the product subject to the sale.

      Total revenues increased by $4,401,000 or 19.4% in the second quarter of
2004 and by $7,324,000 or 15.9% in the first six months of 2004 compared to the
same periods in 2003. These increases in revenues were primarily attributable to
improved business conditions in all three of our main business lines, feeding,
size reduction and pneumatic conveying, and, to a lesser degree, to the positive
effect of a weaker U.S. dollar when translating the revenues of foreign
operations into U.S. dollars. The favorable impact of foreign currency
translation accounted for approximately 15% of the $4,401,000 revenue increase
in the second quarter and approximately 23% of the $7,324,000 revenue increase
in the first six months of 2004 compared to the same periods in 2003.

      Gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased to 41.9% in the
second quarter of 2004 and 42.2% in the first six months of 2004 from 39.7% and
40.0%, respectively, for the same periods in 2003. These increases in gross
profit were primarily due to higher revenues, which led to fixed costs being
absorbed over a larger revenue base, and to geographic and product sales mix.

      Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by
$1,780,000 or 26.6% in the second quarter of 2004 and by $2,787,000 or 20.0% in
the first six months of 2004 compared to the same periods in 2003. These
increases in SG&A were primarily the result of higher sales commissions due to
increased revenues, a higher bonus accrual, the effect of a weaker U.S. dollar
and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the
implementation of software systems within our feeding business line. As a
percent of total revenues, SG&A was 31.2% in the second quarter of 2004 and
31.4% in the first six months of 2004 compared to 29.5% and 30.3%, respectively,
for the same periods in 2003.

      Research and development (R&D) expenditures decreased by $90,000 or 13.3%
in the second quarter of 2004 and by $112,000 or 8.3% in the first six months of
2004 compared to the same periods in 2003. These decreases were primarily due to
lower prototype expenditures and a small reduction in staff partially offset by
the effect of a weaker U.S. dollar. R&D expense as a percent of total revenues
was 2.2% in the second quarter of 2004 and 2.3% in the first six months of 2004
compared to 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively, for the same periods in 2003.

      Interest expense decreased by $52,000 or 13.0% in the second quarter of
2004 and by $66,000 or 8.5% in the first six months of 2004 compared to the same
periods in 2003. These decreases primarily reflected debt reductions. Interest
expense as a percent of total revenues was 1.3% in the second quarter and first
six months of 2004 compared to 1.7% for the same periods in 2003.

      In the first quarter of 2004, one of our United Kingdom subsidiaries sold
its office building for $996,000 and realized a pre-tax gain of $164,000. All
employees were relocated to a nearby office building that is leased by another
United Kingdom subsidiary.

      Income before income taxes was $1,952,000 in the second quarter of 2004
and $4,013,000 in the first six months of 2004 compared to $1,238,000 and
$2,363,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2003. Income before income
taxes improved versus the same periods in 2003 as a result of the items
discussed above.

      The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2004
was 28.8% and 30.0%, respectively, compared to 30.1% and 28.1% for the same
periods in 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the second quarter of
2004 compared to the same period in 2003 was due to a higher percentage of
foreign taxable income in the second quarter of 2004, while the increase in the
effective tax rate for the first six months of 2004 compared to the same period
in 2003 was the result of a higher percentage of U.S. taxable income in the
first six months of 2004.

      Our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by $4,060,000 or
23.4% and $5,682,000 or 36.0% at the end of the second quarter of 2004 compared
to the backlog at January 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively. This increase
in our backlog resulted from the improved business conditions previously
described.

      Total debt decreased by $1,003,000 in the first six months of 2004
($1,017,000 at constant foreign exchange rates). At July 3, 2004 and subject to
certain conditions which may limit the amount that may be borrowed at any
particular time, we had $4,845,000 of unused borrowing capacity under our U.S.
loan agreements and $10,597,000 of unused borrowing capacity under our foreign
loan agreements.

      In June 2004, we prepaid $4,000,000 of unsecured promissory notes bearing
interest at 6% per annum that were payable to the former stockholders of
Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation which we acquired in January 2003. These notes
were payable in three equal annual installments beginning in January 2005. The
payoff was financed with a $4,000,000 term loan from a U.S. bank, repayable over
60 months, with 48 monthly principal payments of $50,000 beginning January 2005,
11 monthly principal payments of $133,333 beginning January 2009 and a final
principal payment of $133,337 in December 2009. Interest is payable monthly
beginning July 2004 at a fixed rate of 5.75% on principal of $1,600,000 and at a
variable rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.85% (2.94% as of July 3, 2004) on the
remaining principal of $2,400,000. The term loan is guaranteed by the U.S.
manufacturing subsidiary for our feeder line and contains the same annual
consolidated financial covenants that already exist with the lender.

      In June 2004, the same U.S. bank extended the term of a $5,000,000 secured
revolving credit facility with the same U.S. manufacturing subsidiary through
July 2006.

Other Items

      At July 3, 2004, working capital was $21,350,000 compared to $17,121,000
at January 3, 2004, and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at
those dates was 1.86 and 1.77, respectively. The working capital increase during
the first six months of 2004 was primarily from an increase in cash from
operating activities and from the sale of the U.K. office building previously
described.

      In the first six months of 2004 and 2003, we utilized internally generated
funds and our lines of credit to meet our working capital needs.

      Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,392,000 in the first six
months of 2004 compared to $5,203,000 in the same period of 2004. The decrease
in operating cash flow during the first six months of 2004 compared to the same
period in 2003 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable,
inventories and prepaid expenses resulting from the stronger business conditions
and higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in net
income, depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued expenses.

      Net cash provided by investing activities in the first six months of 2004
was primarily from the disposition of the U.K. office building noted above,
partially offset by capital additions. Net cash used in investing activities for
the first six months of 2003 was for the acquisition of Pennsylvania Crusher
Corporation in January 2003 and capital additions.

      Cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 2004 was for
net debt reductions, which were partially offset by the proceeds of stock option
exercises, while cash provided by financing activities in the first six months
of 2003 was from borrowings related to the acquisition of Pennsylvania Crusher
Corporation in January 2003.

      Of the total increase in shareholders' equity of $3,967,000 in the first
six months of 2004, $2,811,000 was from net income, $240,000 was from changes in
foreign exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the Swiss franc and
euro versus the U.S. dollar, $871,000 was from the issuance of common stock
related to the exercise of stock options, and $45,000 was from an unrealized
gain net of taxes on an interest rate swap.

Future Payments Under Contractual Obligations

      We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as
debt agreements and lease agreements, and we are subject to certain other
commitments and contingencies. There have been no material changes to Future
Payments Under Contractual Obligations as reflected in the Liquidity and Capital
Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Company's 2003
Form 10-K except for the $4,000,000 debt refinancing and $5,000,000 revolving
credit facility extension, each of which occurred in June 2004 and was described
above. Refer to Notes 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in the
2003 Form 10-K for additional information on long-term debt and commitments and
contingencies.

rapid technological changes and developments and our ability to continue to
introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost-effective basis; (iv)
changes in U.S. and global financial and currency markets, including significant

conditions that are less favorable than expected; (xiii) domestic and
international political and economic conditions; and (xiv) the outcome of any
legal proceedings in which we are involved.

      This list of factors that may affect our future performance and financial
and competitive position and also the accuracy of forward-looking statements is
illustrative, but it is by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking
statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent
uncertainty.

ITEM 3.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

      The Company is currently exposed to certain market risks related to (i)
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and (ii) interest rate changes.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

      See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Results of Operations -- Foreign Exchange Rates" in
Item 2 of this report.

Interest Rate Risk

      The Company has several credit facilities or loans that require the
Company to pay interest at a rate which may change periodically. These variable
rate obligations expose the Company to the risk of increased interest expense in
the event of increases in short-term interest rates. As of July 3, 2004,
approximately $12,336,000 of the Company's total debt of $27,112,000 was subject
to variable interest rates.

ITEM 4.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

      (a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

      An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report was carried out by us under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
have been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms. A controls system, no matter how well designed and
operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls
system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have
been detected. Subsequent to the date of the most recent evaluation of our
internal controls, there were no significant changes in our internal controls,
including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses.

      (b)   Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

      No change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

                           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 4.       SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

      (a)   The Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company was held on May

      (b)   Not applicable

      (c)   Shareholders of the Company were asked to vote on a proposal to
            elect two Class III directors. The Board of Directors nominated
            Norman Cohen and Richard J. Pinola as the Class III directors. There
            were no other nominations. Messrs. Cohen and Pinola were then
            elected as the Class III directors, with the result of the vote
            being as follows:

            Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast; therefore,
            votes cast in the election could not be recorded against or as an
            abstention, nor could broker non-votes be recorded.
