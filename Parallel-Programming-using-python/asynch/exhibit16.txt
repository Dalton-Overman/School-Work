Ladies and Gentlemen:

We were previously principal accountants for K-Tron International, Inc. and,
under the date of February 10, 2003, we reported on the consolidated financial
statements of K-Tron International, Inc. as of and for the year ended December
28, 2002. On August 13, 2003, our appointment as principal accountants was
terminated. We have read K-Tron International Inc.'s statements included under
Item 4 of its Form 8-K dated August 13, 2003, and we agree with such statements,
except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with K-Tron
International Inc.'s statement that Grant Thornton LLP was not engaged regarding
the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on K-Tron International Inc.'s
consolidated financial statements.

Very truly yours,


/s/ KPMG LLP
KPMG LLP
