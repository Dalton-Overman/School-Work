                    K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC. & SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  April 3, 2004
                                   (Unaudited)

1.       Basis of Presentation

         The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
         prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not
         include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
         complete financial statements. The consolidated financial statements
         include the accounts of K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries
         ("K-Tron" or the "Company"). All intercompany transactions have been
         eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all
         adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered
         necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
         been made.

         Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year's consolidated
         financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.

         The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction
         with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
         January 3, 2004 which was previously filed with the Securities and
         Exchange Commission.

2.       New Accounting Pronouncements

         In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation
         of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). In general, a variable
         interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
         structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have
         equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do
         not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support
         its activities. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to
         be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the
         investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
         interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
         finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
         support from other parties. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46
         apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January
         31, 2003. The adoption of the provisions of FIN 46 effective February
         1, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
         financial statements since the Company currently does not have variable
         interest entities. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R with
         respect to variable interest entities created before January 31, 2003,
         which, among other things, revised the implementation date to the first
         fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004, with the
         exception of Special Purpose Entities ("SPE"). The consolidation
         requirements apply to all SPEs in the first fiscal year or interim
         period ending after December 15, 2003. The Company's adoption of the
         provisions of FIN 46R effective January 3, 2004 did not have a material
         impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements since the
         Company currently does not have any SPEs, nor does it have any variable
         interest entities.

3.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

         purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
         equivalents.

         Cash paid for interest in the three-month periods ended April 3, 2004
         and March 29, 2003 was $371,000 and $104,000, respectively, and for

8.       Earnings Per Share

         The Company previously adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share",
         which requires that the Company report Basic and Diluted Earnings Per
         Share. Basic Earnings Per Share represents net income less preferred
         dividends divided by the weighted average number of common shares
         outstanding. Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated similarly, except
         that the denominator includes the weighted average number of common
         shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of options, warrants,
         convertible securities and other instruments with dilutive effects if
         exercised.

         The Company's Diluted Earnings Per Share shown in the table below are
         based on the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
         shares outstanding during a given time period. Such average shares
         include the weighted average number of common

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

         shares outstanding plus the shares issuable upon exercise of stock
         options after the assumed repurchase of common shares with the related
         proceeds.

         The Company's Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share are calculated as
         follows:

9.       Stock-Based Compensation

         As permitted under SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, the
         Company has elected to continue to account for compensation cost using
         the intrinsic value-based method of accounting as prescribed by
         Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
         Issued to Employees". SFAS No. 123 requires the Company to disclose pro
         forma net income and pro forma earnings per share amounts, as if
         compensation expense were recognized for options granted after fiscal
         year 1994. Using this approach, net income and earnings per share would
         have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following
         table:

         This pro forma impact may not be representative of the effects for
         future years, and could increase if additional options are granted and
         amortized over the vesting period. For disclosure purposes, the fair
         value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant
         using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
         weighted average assumptions for options granted in 2003: no dividend
         yield; expected volatility of 30.80%; risk-free interest rate of 2.76%;
         and expected life of 6.00 years. No options were granted in the first
         three months of 2004.

         The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
         estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
         restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing
         models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the
         expected stock price volatility.

10.      Comprehensive Income

         Comprehensive income is the total of net income, the change in the
         unrealized gain or loss on the Company's interest rate swap, net of

11.      Management Segment Information

         The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures
         About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS No. 131
         introduced a model for segment reporting called the management
         approach. The management approach is based on the way that the chief
         operating decision-maker organizes segments within a company for making
         operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company is engaged
         in one business segment, material handling equipment and systems. The
         Company operates in two primary geographic locations, North and South
         America (the "Americas") and Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia
         ("EMEA/Asia").

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.

INTRODUCTION

         We are engaged in one principal business segment - material handling
equipment and systems. We operate in two primary geographic locations - North
and South America (the "Americas") and Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia
("EMEA/Asia").

         We have three main business lines within the material handling
equipment and systems segment. They are our feeding, size reduction and
pneumatic conveying business lines.

         The following provides information that management believes is relevant
to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and
financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. All references in this
Item 2 to the first three months or first quarters of 2004 and 2003 mean the
fiscal quarters ended April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003, respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

         Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in
our 2003 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and included as part of our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended January 3, 2004 (the "2003 Form 10-K"). The preparation of
those financial statements required management to make estimates and assumptions
that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

         The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in
Note 2 to the 2003 consolidated financial statements, and the critical
accounting policies and estimates are described in Management's Discussion and
Analysis included in our 2003 Form 10-K. Information concerning our
implementation and the impact of new accounting standards issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is included in the notes to the 2003
consolidated financial statements. Otherwise, we did not adopt an accounting
policy in the current period that had a material impact on our financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

         For the first three months of 2004 and 2003, we reported revenues of
$26,321,000 and $23,398,000 and net income of $1,422,000 and $835,000,
respectively. The increases in first quarter 2004 revenues and net income
compared with the first quarter of 2003 were primarily the result of improved
business conditions in our size reduction and feeding business lines, and also
reflect the positive effect of a weaker U.S. dollar when translating the
revenues and profits of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars. First quarter
2004 net income also benefited from the profit contribution from the sale of an
office building by one of our United Kingdom subsidiaries.

Foreign Exchange Rates

         We are an international company, and we derived 43.8% and 43.5% of our
revenues for the first three months of 2004 and 2003, respectively, from
products manufactured in, and services performed from, our facilities located
outside the United States, primarily in Europe. Since we operate globally, we
are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange
rates"), which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into
U.S. dollars as well as transactions where the revenues and related expenses may
initially be accounted for in different currencies, such as sales made from our
Swiss manufacturing facility in currencies other than the Swiss franc.

         Since we have received substantial revenues in recent years from
activities in foreign jurisdictions, our results can be significantly affected
by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in U.S. dollar exchange rates
with respect to the Swiss franc, euro and British pound sterling and, to a
lesser degree, the Singapore dollar and other currencies. When the U.S. dollar
weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based
sales increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. Correspondingly, the
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar
weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, our revenues in
U.S. dollars generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected
by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide, especially those
identified above. In particular, a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against
other currencies would positively affect our revenues, gross profit and
operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars (provided that the gross profit
and operating income numbers from foreign operations are not losses, since in
the case of a loss, the effect would be to increase the loss), whereas a general
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such currencies would have the opposite
effect. In addition, our revenues and income with respect to particular
transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales
are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility
manufacturing the product subject to the sale.

         Total revenues increased by $2,923,000 or 12.5% in the first quarter of
2004 compared to the same period in 2003. This increase in revenues was
primarily attributable to improved business conditions in markets served by our
two largest business lines, feeding and size reduction, as well as to the
positive effect of a weaker U.S. dollar when translating the revenues of foreign
operations into U.S. dollars. The favorable impact of foreign currency
translation accounted for approximately one-third of the 12.5% revenue increase
in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003.

         Gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased to 42.5% in the
first quarter of 2004 from 40.3% for the same period in 2003. This increase in
gross profit was primarily due to geographic and product sales mix and to the
improved business conditions discussed above, which led to fixed costs being
absorbed over a larger revenue base.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by
$1,007,000 or 13.9% in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in
2003. This increase in SG&A was primarily due to the effect of a weaker U.S.
dollar, higher sales commissions because of increased revenues, a higher bonus
accrual and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the
implementation of software systems within the feeding business line. As a
percent of total revenues, SG&A was 31.4% in the first quarter of 2004 compared
to 31.0% for the same period in 2003.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures decreased by $22,000 or
3.3% in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. This
decrease was primarily due to a reduction in staff partially offset by the
effect of a weaker U.S. dollar. R&D expense as a percent of total revenues was
2.5% in the first quarter of 2004 compared to 2.9% for the same period in 2003.

         Interest expense decreased by $14,000 or 3.7% in the first quarter of
2004 compared to the same period in 2003. This decrease in interest expense was
due to debt reductions. Interest expense as a percent of total revenues was 1.4%
in the first quarter of 2004 compared to 1.6% for the same period in 2003.

         In the first quarter of 2004, one of our United Kingdom subsidiaries
sold its office building for $996,000 and realized a pre-tax gain of $164,000.
All employees were relocated to a nearby office building that is leased by
another United Kingdom subsidiary.

         Income before income taxes was $2,061,000 in the first quarter of 2004
compared to $1,125,000 for the same period in 2003. Income before income taxes
improved versus the same period in 2003 as a result of the items discussed
above.

         The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2004 was 31.0% compared
to 25.8% for the same period in 2003. This increase was the result of a higher
percentage of U.S. income in 2004.

         Our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by $4,303,000
or 25.2% and $5,474,000 or 34.4% at the end of the first quarter of 2004
compared to January 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003, respectively. This increase in
our backlog resulted from the improved business conditions previously described.

</TABLE>

         Total debt decreased by $238,000 in the first three months of 2004
($200,000 at constant foreign exchange rates). At April 3, 2004 and subject to
certain conditions which may limit the amount that may be borrowed at any
particular time, we had $5,290,000 of unused borrowing capacity under our U.S.
loan agreements and $9,676,000 of unused borrowing capacity under our foreign
loan agreements.

Other Items

         At April 3, 2004, working capital was $18,177,000 compared to
$17,121,000 at January 3, 2004, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was the same at 1.77. The working capital increase
during the first quarter of 2004 was primarily the result of the cash received
from the sale of the office building noted above.

         In the first three months of 2004 and 2003, we utilized internally
generated funds and our lines of credit to meet our working capital needs.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $908,000 in the first
three months of 2004 compared to $1,246,000 in the same period of 2003. The
decrease in operating cash flow during the first three months of 2004 compared
to the same period in 2003 was primarily due to an increase in accounts
receivable and inventories as a result of higher business volumes. This was
partially offset by an increase in net income and a decrease in accounts payable
and accrued expenses.

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

         Net cash provided by investing activities in the first three months of
2004 was primarily from the disposition of the office building noted above,
offset by capital additions. Net cash used in investing activities for the first
three months of 2003 was for the acquisition of Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation
in January 2003 and capital additions.

         Cash provided by financing activities in the first three months of 2004
was primarily from the proceeds of stock option exercises net of debt
reductions, while cash provided by financing activities in the first three
months of 2003 was from the borrowings related to the acquisition of
Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation in January 2003.

         Shareholders' equity increased $595,000 in the first quarter of 2004,
after taking into account a $1,026,000 foreign exchange translation decrease.

Future Payments Under Contractual Obligations

         We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such
as debt agreements and lease agreements, and we are subject to certain other
commitments and contingencies. There have been no material changes to Future
Payments Under Contractual Obligations as reflected in the Liquidity and Capital
Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Company's 2003
Form 10-K. Refer to Notes 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in
the 2003 Form 10-K for additional information on long-term debt and commitments
and contingencies.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS

         The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act")
provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our
behalf. We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral
statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this
report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to
our shareholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations,
estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Act. In addition, other written or oral statements which
constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words
such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks,"
"estimates," "projects," "forecasts," "may," "should," variations of such words
and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what
is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements contained in this report include but are not
limited to statements regarding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates
on our business. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

         A wide range of factors could materially affect our future performance
and financial and competitive position, including the following: (i) increasing
price and product/service competition by domestic and foreign competitors,
including new entrants; (ii) the mix of products/services sold by us; (iii)
rapid technological changes and developments and our ability to continue to
introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost-effective basis; (iv)
changes in U.S. and global financial and currency markets, including significant
interest rate and

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; (v) protection and validity of
patents and other intellectual property rights held by us and our competitors;
(vi) the cyclical nature of our business as an industrial capital goods
supplier; (vii) possible future litigation and governmental proceedings; (viii)
the availability of financing and financial resources in the amounts, at the
times and on the terms required to support our future business, including for
debt refinancings, capacity expansions and possible acquisitions; (ix) the loss
of key customers, employees or suppliers; (x) the failure to carry out marketing
and sales plans; (xi) the failure to integrate acquired businesses without
substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems; (xii)
economic, business and regulatory conditions and changes which may affect the
level of new investments and purchases made by our customers, including economic
and business conditions that are less favorable than expected; (xiii) domestic
and international political and economic conditions; and (xiv) the outcome of
any legal proceedings in which we are involved.

         This list of factors that may affect our future performance and
financial and competitive position and also the accuracy of forward-looking
statements is illustrative, but it is by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all
forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their
inherent uncertainty.

Results of Operations" -- Results of Operations - Foreign Exchange Rates in Item
2 of this report.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

         (a)      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

         An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report was carried out by us under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
have been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms. A controls system, no matter how well designed and
operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls
system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have
been detected. Subsequent to the date of the most recent evaluation of our
internal controls, there were no significant changes in our internal controls,
including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses.

         (b)      Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

         No change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

                                  CERTIFICATION

I, Edward B. Cloues, II, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
     April 3, 2004 of K-Tron International, Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

               (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
          such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

               (b) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
          controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
          about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as

          evaluation; and

               (c) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
          internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
          registrant's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
          or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
          internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

               (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
          design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
          are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

<PAGE>

               (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
          or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's

     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

               (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
          such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

          evaluation; and

               (c) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
          internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the

          or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
          internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

               (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
          design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
          are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

<PAGE>

               (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
          or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
          internal control over financial reporting.
