              K-TRON REPORTS $0.55 PER SHARE FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

Pitman, New Jersey - - April 27, 2004 - - K-Tron International, Inc.
(NASDAQ-KTII) today reported first quarter 2004 net income of $1.422 million, or
$0.55 per share (diluted), on revenues of $26.32 million compared to net income
of $835 thousand, or $0.34 per share (diluted), on revenues of $23.40 million
for the same period in 2003.

In announcing the above results, the Company pointed out that if the average
foreign currency exchange rates for the first quarter of 2003 were applied to
the first quarter of 2004, the Company's revenues would have increased
approximately 8.4 percent instead of almost 12.5 percent, and the gains in its
net income and earnings per share in the first quarter of 2004 over the
corresponding numbers in 2003 would have been lower than reported. This is due
in each case to a significantly weaker U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2004
compared to the same period in 2003 against the Swiss franc, the euro and other
relevant foreign currencies.

Commenting on the Company's results, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Edward B. Cloues, II said, "K-Tron reported strong first quarter revenues and
earnings compared to a year ago, reflecting an improved business environment.
First quarter revenues were up more than $2.9 million, or about 12.5 percent,
versus last year's first quarter, while income before income taxes increased by
$936 thousand, or 83.2 percent, including a $164 thousand gain on the sale of a
small office building in England formerly occupied by the Company. Net income
for the period was up $587 thousand, or 70.3 percent, while earnings per share
(diluted) were almost 62 percent higher."

In reviewing other first quarter highlights, Mr. Cloues noted that bookings were
up versus the first quarter of 2003, reflecting a continuation of the better
business conditions that the Company first began to experience in the fourth
quarter of 2003. He also pointed out that cash increased by $1.3 million in the
first quarter, from $4.5 million at the end of fiscal 2003 to $5.8 million at
the end of the first quarter, while debt was reduced by approximately $240
thousand. About $1 million of the $1.3 million cash increase represented the
proceeds from the sale of the office building in England. Foreign exchange was
not a significant factor in any of these changes.
