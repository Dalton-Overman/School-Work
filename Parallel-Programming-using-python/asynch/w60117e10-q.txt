1.       Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles

the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full
year.

Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year's consolidated financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2001
which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

million and $0.3 million, respectively, and for income taxes was zero and $0.1
million, respectively.

7.       Goodwill


The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on December 30, 2001. This Statement
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no
longer be amortized. The Statement requires the Company to conduct an
impairment test of goodwill to assess whether there is an indication that
goodwill is impaired within six months of the adoption date of the standard.
If this test indicates that goodwill may be impaired, the Company is required
to conduct a second test to calculate the amount of impairment loss by
December 28, 2002. In subsequent years, an impairment test will be performed
on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that
goodwill may be impaired. The Company is currently performing an impairment
test of goodwill as of December 30, 2001.

As required by SFAS 142, the Company has reassessed the balance sheet
classification, useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible
assets. As a result of this assessment, no adjustments or reclassifications
were required and only goodwill was determined to have an indefinite life.
Goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001 was $345 thousand on an after-tax basis,
or $0.14 per share. Goodwill amortization for the three months ended March 31,
2001 was $132 thousand on an after-tax basis, or $0.05 per share.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         For the first three months of 2002 and 2001, we reported net income
of $0.751 million and $0.975 million, respectively. On July 31, 2001, we sold
our Hasler heavy feeder business, which sale is more fully discussed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2001. Revenues and
profits for the first quarter declined from year ago levels due to both the
Hasler sale and a weaker global economy with reduced capital equipment
spending.

         We are an international company, and we derived approximately 55% and
58% of our first three months 2002 and 2001 revenues, respectively, from
products manufactured in, and services performed from, our facilities located
outside the United States, primarily in Europe. Since we operate globally, we
are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange
rates"), which can affect both the translation of financial statement items
into U.S. dollars and the impact of transactions where the revenues and
related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies, such
as sales made from our Swiss manufacturing facility in currencies other than
the Swiss franc.

         The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as
a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

         As previously noted, more than half of our revenues are normally
derived from activities in foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, our results can
be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in
U.S. dollar exchange rates with respect to the Swiss franc and euro and, to a
lesser degree, the British pound sterling and other currencies. When the U.S.
dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S.
dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens against these
currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases.
Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases
when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens.
Overall, since we typically receive a majority of our revenues in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, we generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are
adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide,
especially those identified above. Accordingly, changes in foreign exchange
rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely
affect our total revenues, gross profit and operating income as expressed in
U.S. dollars.

         In addition, our revenues and income with respect to particular
transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales
are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility
manufacturing the product subject to the sale, including in particular the U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc (for inter-company transactions) and the euro/Swiss franc
(for sales from the Company's Swiss manufacturing facility) exchange rates. For
the first three months of 2002 and 2001, the changes in these and the U.S.
dollar/euro exchange rates were as follows:

         Total revenues decreased by $4.99 million or 23.1% ($3.06 million or
15.6% without Hasler) in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the same period
in 2001. Compared to the first quarter of 2001 and excluding Hasler, the
decrease in revenues for the first three months of 2002 was driven by declines
in Western Europe and to a lesser extent in North America, partially offset by a
full quarter of revenues from a November 2001 acquisition in the United Kingdom.
The effect of foreign exchange translation was minimal when comparing 2002 with
2001.

         Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 43.1% for the first
quarter of 2002 compared to 41.3% for the same period in 2001. The improvement
in gross profit was primarily due to the change in sales mix as a result of the
July 31, 2001 sale of the Hasler business and a reduction in fixed costs,
including the elimination of goodwill expense as the Company adopted SFAS No.
142 on December 30, 2001.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $1.2
million or 19.2% ($0.5 million or 8.1% without Hasler) for the first quarter of
2002 compared to the same period in 2001. The decrease in 2002 SG&A was
primarily due to lower commissions on the reduced revenues, fewer employees and
the elimination of Hasler SG&A. As a percent of total revenues, SG&A for the
first quarter of 2002 was 31.7% compared to 30.1% for the same period in 2001.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures decreased by $43 thousand
or 5.7% for the first quarter of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001. R&D
expenses decreased due to lower staff costs, offset in part by an increase in
tooling costs. R&D expense as a percent of total revenues was 4.3% for the first
quarter compared to 3.5% for the same period in 2001.

         Interest expense decreased by $138 thousand or 44.4% for the first
quarter of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001. The decrease for the first
quarter was primarily due to lower interest rates and debt reductions.

         The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2002 was 25.3% compared
to 27.5% for the same period in 2001. The lower effective tax rate in 2002 was
primarily due to lower taxable income in the United States.

         The backlog of non-Hasler customer orders decreased by 5.0% at the end
of the first quarter of 2002 compared to year end 2001 and by 18.3% compared to
the end of the first quarter in 2001, in each case at constant foreign exchange
rates. The decrease as compared to the end of 2001 was primarily the result of
lower orders received in Switzerland while the decrease as compared to the first
quarter of 2001 was the result of lower orders received at our facilities in
Switzerland and the United States.

</TABLE>

         Total debt decreased by $1.65 million in the first three months of
2002, or $1.63 million when adjusted to a constant foreign exchange rate, with
U.S. debt decreasing by $1.63 million. At March 30, 2002, we had $5.0 million
of unused borrowing availability under our U.S. revolving credit agreement and
$1.6 million of unused borrowing availability under our foreign loan
agreements.

         At March 30, 2002, working capital was $15.1 million compared to
$15.6 million at December 29, 2001, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was 2.08 and 2.18, respectively.

         In the first three months of 2002 and 2001, we utilized
internally-generated funds to meet our working capital needs.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 million in the
first three months of 2002 compared to $1.0 million in the same period of
2001. The increase in operating cash flow during the first three months of
2002 compared to the same period in 2001 was primarily due to a reduction in
inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first three months of
2002 and 2001 was primarily for capital additions.

         Cash used in financing activities in the first three months of 2002
was primarily for debt reduction.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and euro, caused a decrease in shareholders' equity of $89
thousand in the first three months of 2002.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS

     The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides
a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We
and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements
that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this report and
other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to our
shareholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations,
estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Act. In addition, other written or oral statements which
constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf.
Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes,"
"seeks," "estimates," "projects," "forecasts," "may," "should," variations of
such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are
difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this
report include statements regarding the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on our business. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

         A wide range of factors could materially affect our future
performance and financial and competitive position, including the following:
(i) increasing price and product/service competition by domestic and foreign
competitors, including new entrants; (ii) the mix of products/services sold by
us; (iii) rapid technological changes and developments and our ability to
continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost-effective
basis; (iv) changes in U.S. and global financial and currency markets,
including significant interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations; (v) protection and validity of patent and other intellectual
property rights held by us and our competitors; (vi) the cyclical nature of
our business as a capital goods supplier; (vii) possible future litigation and
governmental proceedings; (viii) the availability of financing and financial
resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support
our future business, including capacity expansions and possible acquisitions;
(ix) the loss of key customers, employees or suppliers; (x) the failure to
carry out marketing and sales plans; (xi) the failure to integrate acquired
businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial
problems; (xii) economic, business and regulatory conditions and changes which
may affect the level of new investments and purchases made by customers,
including general economic and business conditions that are less favorable
than expected; (xiii) domestic and international political and economic
conditions; and (xiv) the outcome of any legal proceeding in which we are
involved.

         This list of factors that may affect our future performance and
financial and competitive position and also the accuracy of forward-looking
statements is illustrative, but it is by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all
forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their
inherent uncertainty.
