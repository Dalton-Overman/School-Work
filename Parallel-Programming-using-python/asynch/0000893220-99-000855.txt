                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   ------------------------------------------

1.       Basis of Presentation
         ---------------------

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("K-Tron" or the "Company").
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
been made. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 1999 which
was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information
         -------------------------------------------------

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash paid in the first
six months of 1999 and 1998 for interest was $.2 million and $.3 million,
respectively, and for income taxes was $.4 million and $1.2 million,
respectively.

3.       Earnings per Share
         ------------------

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128 requires that the Company report Basic
and Diluted Earnings Per Share. Basic Earnings Per Share represents net income
less preferred dividends divided by the weighted average common shares
outstanding. Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated similarly, except that the
denominator includes weighted average common shares outstanding plus the
dilutive effect of options, warrants, convertible securities and other
instruments with dilutive effects if exercised.

4.       Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements
         ---------------------------------------

In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income".
SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is the total of
net income and the current year change in cumulative translation adjustments
which is the only nonowner change in equity. For the three and six months in the
periods ended July 3, 1999 and July 4, 1998, the following table sets forth the
Company's comprehensive income:

In 1998 the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 introduces a
new model for segment reporting called the management approach. The management
approach is based on the way that the chief operating decision maker organizes
segments within a company for making operating decisions and assessing
performance.

The Company is engaged in one business segment, the development, manufacturing
and marketing of gravimetric and volumetric feeders, pneumatic conveying systems
and related equipment. The Company operates in two primary geographic locations,
North America and Western Europe. For the three and six months in the periods
ended July 3, 1999 and July 4, 1998, the following tables set forth the
Company's segment information:

         ---------------------------------------------------------------
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

         For the second quarter and first six months of 1999, the Company
reported net income of $1,819,000 and $3,179,000, respectively, compared to
$1,815,000 and $3,122,000 for the same periods in 1998.

         K-Tron is an international company which derived approximately 61% and
57% of its first six months of 1999 and 1998 revenues, respectively, from
products manufactured in, and services performed from, its facilities located
outside the United States, primarily in Europe. As such, the financial position
and performance of the Company is sensitive to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates ("foreign exchange rates"), which can affect both the translation
of financial statement items into U.S. dollars and the impact of transactions
where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in
different currencies, such as sales made from the Company's Swiss manufacturing
facilities in currencies other than the Swiss franc.

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

         As noted above, more than half of the Company's revenues are normally
derived from activities in foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, the Company's
results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates,
particularly in U.S. dollar exchange rates with respect to the Swiss franc,
German mark and euro and, to a lesser degree, the British pound sterling, French
franc and other currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these
currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When
the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of
non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of
non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases
when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, the Company typically receives a
majority of its revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such,
benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar
relative to major currencies worldwide, especially those identified above.
Accordingly, changes in foreign exchange rates, and in particular a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect the Company's total
revenues, gross profit and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars.

         In addition, revenues and income of the Company with respect to
particular transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates
where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the
facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale, including in particular
the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc (for inter-company transactions) and the euro/Swiss
franc and German mark/Swiss franc exchange rates (for sales from the Company's
Swiss manufacturing facilities which are made in euros or German marks). For the
second quarter and first six months of 1999 as well as the same periods in 1998,
the changes in these and the U.S. dollar/euro and U.S. dollar/German mark
exchange rates were as follows:

revenues increased and North American revenues decreased in the second quarter
and first six months of 1999 as compared to the same periods in 1998. As
reflected in the preceding chart, revenues for the first half of 1999 were
insignificantly affected by the foreign exchange translation while revenues for
the second quarter of 1999 would have been slightly higher than the same period
in 1998 if translated at prior year rates.

         Gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to 44.3% for the second
quarter of 1999 and 45.1% for the first six months of 1999 as compared to 46.4%
and 45.7% for the same periods in 1998. The reduction in gross margin in 1999
was primarily due to sales mix.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $.5
million or 6.8% for the second quarter of 1999 and by $.7 million or 5.2% for
the first six months of 1999 as compared to the same periods in 1998. This
decrease in SG&A was due to lower selling expenses, as well as to lower foreign
exchange translation rates. As a percent of total revenues, SG&A for the second
quarter and first six months of 1999 was 29.6% and 31.4%, respectively, compared
to 32.2% and 32.1% for the same periods in 1998.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures increased by $.2 million or
32.3% for the second quarter of 1999 and by $.3 million or 21.6% for the first
six months of 1999 as compared to the same periods in 1998. R&D expenses
increased due to greater emphasis on the development of new products and
enhancements to existing products, offset in part by lower foreign exchange
translation rates. R&D expense as a percent of total revenues was 4.0% for the
second quarter and first six months of 1999 as compared to 3.1% and 3.2%,
respectively, for the same periods in 1998.

         Interest expense decreased by $.1 million or 28.1% for the first six
months of 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998, primarily due to weighted
average lower debt levels and lower rates on some loans.

         The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of
1999 were 20.6% and 17.5%, respectively, compared to 22.4% and 25.3% for the
same periods in 1998. The effective tax rates for 1999 were lower than the same
periods in 1998 due to reduced taxable income in the United States. The
effective tax rates for both 1999 and 1998 were also reduced by the utilization
of foreign net operating loss carryforwards with full valuation allowances.

         The backlog decreased by 1.4% at the end of the second quarter when
compared to the end of 1998 and by 12.0% when compared to the same period in
1998, in each case at constant foreign exchange rates. The decrease was
primarily in Europe.

</TABLE>

         Total debt increased by $.6 million in the first six months of 1999,
and this increase would have been $1.7 million using a constant foreign exchange
rate. U.S. debt decreased by $.1 million while European debt increased by $.7
million ($1.8 million at a constant foreign exchange rate). At July 3, 1999, the
Company had $5.0 million of availability under its U.S. loan agreements and $1.6
million of availability under its Swiss loan agreements.

         At July 3, 1999, there was working capital of $11.9 million as compared
to $11.4 million at January 2, 1999, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was 1.51 and 1.49, respectively.

         In the first six months of 1999, the Company utilized internally-
generated funds and short-term borrowings to meet its working capital needs.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $.1 million in the first
six months of 1999 as compared to $2.4 million in the same period of 1998. The
lower operating cash flow for 1999 as compared to 1998 was primarily due to a
reduction in accrued expenses and accounts payable and an increase in prepaid
expenses.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 1999
and 1998 was for capital additions.

         Net cash provided by financing activities in the first six months of
1999 was primarily from net borrowings used for working capital and the proceeds
from the issuance of common stock offset by the purchase of 116,400 shares from
two shareholders.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and German mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease in
shareholders' equity of $1.6 million in the first six months of 1999.

Readiness for Year 2000
- -----------------------

         The Company has substantially completed an evaluation of its
information technology infrastructure for Year 2000 compliance and has
substantially implemented its Year 2000 compliance strategy. The cost to modify
its information technology infrastructure to be Year 2000 compliant has not been
and is not expected to be material to its financial condition or results of
operations. The Company does not anticipate any material disruptions in its
business as a result of any failure by the Company to be Year 2000 compliant.

         The Company anticipates having all systems Year 2000 compliant no later
than September 30, 1999 and has not developed a contingency plan. If Year 2000
compliance issues are discovered, the Company then will evaluate the need for a
contingency plan relative to those issues.

         The Company is also in the process of obtaining information concerning
the Year 2000 compliance status of its significant suppliers, customers and
business partners to determine the extent to which the Company is vulnerable to
these third parties' failure to remedy their Year 2000 problems. There can be no
assurance that such suppliers, customers and business partners are or will be
Year 2000 compliant. The risk to the Company resulting from the failure of third
parties in the public and private sector to attain Year 2000 readiness is the
same as for other firms in the Company's industry or other business enterprises
generally and could involve many different types of disruption to the Company's
business.

         The costs to complete the Company's Year 2000 evaluation and to secure
Year 2000 compliance are based on management's best estimates. These estimates
were derived using numerous assumptions, including continued availability of
resources, third party contingency plans and other factors. However, there can
be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated. The following are representative of
the types of risks that could result in the event a critical component of the
Company's information systems, factories or facilities fails to be Year 2000
ready, or there is a similar failure by one or more major third party suppliers
to the Company: (i) information systems--could include interruptions or
disruptions of business and transaction processing such as customer billing,
payroll, accounts payable and other operating and information processes, until
systems can be remedied or replaced; (ii) factories and facilities--could
include interruptions or disruptions of manufacturing processes and facilities
with delays in delivery of products, until non-compliant conditions or
components can be remedied or replaced; and (iii) major suppliers to the
Company--could include interruptions or disruptions of the supply of materials
and supplies which could cause interruptions or disruptions of manufacturing and
delays in delivery of products, until the third party supplier can remedy the
problem or contingency measures can be implemented.
