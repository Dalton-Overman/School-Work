common and common equivalent shares outstanding during a given time period. Such
average shares include the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
plus the shares issuable upon exercise of stock options after the assumed
repurchase of common shares with the related proceeds.

7.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations," and
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB
No. 16 "Business Combinations" and FASB Statement No. 38, "Accounting for
Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises." All business
combinations in the scope of this Statement are to be accounted for using one
method, the purchase method. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB
No. 17, "Intangible Assets". It changes the accounting for goodwill from an
amortization method to an impairment only approach. K-Tron will cease the
amortization of goodwill which was recorded in past business combinations on
December 31, 2001, as required by SFAS No. 142. Amortization expense was
$487,000 during fiscal 2000, or $0.19 per share. The Company is still evaluating
the impact of adopting these pronouncements on the financial statements.

ITEM 2.        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Results of Operations

        For the second quarter and first six months of 2001, K-Tron reported net
income of $0.610 million and $1.585 million, respectively, compared to $1.832
million and $3.205 million for the same periods in 2000. Revenues and profits
for the second quarter declined significantly from year ago levels reflecting
the weak U.S. economy and a dramatic slowdown in capital spending, especially in
the plastics and chemical industries. By contrast, last year's second quarter
profit was at a record level, driven by strong domestic sales.

        We are an international company, and we derived approximately 60% and
52% of our first six months 2001 and 2000 revenues, respectively, from products
manufactured in, and services performed from, our facilities located outside the
United States, primarily in Europe. Accordingly, we are sensitive to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange rates"), which can affect
both the translation of financial statement items into U.S. dollars and the
impact of transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be
accounted for in different currencies, such as sales made from our Swiss
manufacturing facility in currencies other than the Swiss franc.

        The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a
percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

        More than half of our revenues are normally derived from activities in
foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, our results can be significantly affected
by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in U.S. dollar exchange rates
with respect to the Swiss franc and euro and, to a lesser degree, the British
pound sterling and other currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against
these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales
decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the U.S.
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S.
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar
weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, since we
typically receive a majority of our revenues in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, we generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by
a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide, especially those
identified above. Accordingly, changes in foreign exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect our total
revenues, gross profit and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars.

        In addition, our revenues and income with respect to particular
transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales
are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility
manufacturing the product subject to the sale, including in particular the U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc (for inter-company transactions) and the euro/Swiss franc
(for sales from the Company's Swiss manufacturing facility) exchange rates. For
the first three and six months of 2001and 2000, the changes in these and the
U.S. dollar/euro exchange rates were as follows:

        Total revenues decreased by $2.8 million or 12.5% in the second quarter
of 2001and by $1.5 million or 3.5% in the first six months of 2001 compared to
the same periods in 2000. North American revenues decreased and Western European
revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2001 compared
to the same periods in 2000. If the average foreign exchange rates for the
second quarter and first six months of 2001 were applied to the same periods in
2000, total revenues would have decreased by $2.2 million or 10.0% for the
quarter and by $0.5 million or 1.2% for the first six months.

        Gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to 39.8% for the second
quarter of 2001 and 40.6% for the first six months of 2001 compared to 47.4% and
46.6% for the same periods in 2000. The decrease in gross margin in 2001 was
primarily due to geographic and product sales mix. The decrease in gross profit
was also due to the deterioration of economic conditions discussed above, which
led to fixed costs being absorbed over a smaller revenue base.

        Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $0.9
million or 13.3% for the second quarter of 2001 and decreased by $0.7 million or
5.6% for the first six months of 2001 compared to the same periods in 2000. The
decrease in SG&A for the second quarter and first six months was primarily due
to lower sales commissions resulting from reduced revenues and lower foreign
exchange translation rates. As a percent of total revenues, SG&A for the second
quarter and first six months of 2001 was 30.4% and 30.3%, respectively, compared
to 30.6% and 30.9% for the same periods in 2000.

        Research and development (R&D) expenditures decreased by $44 thousand or
5.4% for the second quarter of 2001 and by $122 thousand or 7.4% for the first
six months of 2001 compared to the same periods in 2000. R&D expenses decreased
due to lower staff costs as well as the effect of lower foreign exchange
translation rates. R&D expense as a percent of total revenues was 4.0% for the
second quarter and 3.7% for the first six months of 2001 compared to 3.7% and
3.9%, respectively, for the same periods in 2000.

        Interest expense decreased by $58 thousand or 17.4% for the second
quarter of 2001 and increased by $131 thousand or 28.8% for the first six months
of 2001 compared to the same periods in 2000. The decrease for the second
quarter was primarily due to reduced interest rates while the increase for the
six months was primarily due to interest on funds borrowed in March 2000 related
to the repurchase of 508 thousand shares of our Common Stock, partially offset
by reduced interest rates.

        The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of
2001 were 21.5% and 25.3%, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 29.6% for the
same periods in 2000. The lower effective tax rate in 2001 was primarily due to
decreased taxable income in the United States.

        The backlog of customer orders decreased by 24.3% at the end of the
second quarter of 2001 compared to the end of 2000 and by 16.9% compared to the
end of the second quarter in 2000, in each case at constant foreign exchange
rates. Most of the decrease was the result of lower orders received at our
facility in the United States. At the end of June 2001, our worldwide backlog
was $15.1 million, representing the lowest quarterly backlog in several years.

        Total debt decreased by $0.8 million in the first six months of 2001 or
$0.1 million when adjusted to a constant foreign exchange rate, with U.S. debt
decreasing by $0.7 million and debt in Switzerland decreasing by $0.1 million.
At June 30, 2001, we had $4.0 million of borrowing availability under our U.S.
loan agreements and $4.1 million of borrowing availability under our Swiss loan
agreements.

        At June 30, 2001, working capital was $14.1 million compared to $13.8
million at December 30, 2000, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was 1.79 and 1.67, respectively. The increase in
working capital was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payables partially
offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.

        In the first six months of 2001 and 2000, we utilized
internally-generated funds and our lines of credit to meet our working capital
needs while in 2000 we also used bank borrowings and available cash to complete
a share repurchase.

        Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 million in the first
six months of 2001 compared to $4.4 million in the same period of 2000. The
first six months of 2001 decrease in operating cash flow as compared to the same
period in 2000 was primarily due to lower net income and a decrease in accounts
payable net of accrued expenses.

        Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 2001
and 2000 was primarily for capital additions.

        Cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 2000 was
primarily for the purchase of 508,000 shares of common stock.

        Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and euro, caused a translation adjustment decrease in shareholders'
equity of $1.4 million in the first six months of 2001.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS

        The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act")
provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our
behalf. We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral
statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this
report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to
our shareholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations,
estimates, forecasts and projections are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Act. In addition, other written or oral statements which
constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words
such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks,"
"estimates," "projects," "forecasts," "may," "should," variations of such words
and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what
is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

        A wide range of factors could materially affect our future performance
and financial and competitive position, including the following: (i) increasing
price and product/service competition by domestic and foreign competitors,
including new entrants; (ii) the mix of products/services sold by us; (iii)
rapid technological changes and developments and our ability to continue to
introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost-effective basis; (iv)
changes in U.S. and global financial and currency markets, including significant
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; (v) protection
and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights held by us and our
competitors; (vi) the cyclical nature of our business as a capital goods
supplier; (vii) possible future litigation and governmental proceedings; (viii)
the availability of financing and financial resources in the amounts, at the
times and on the terms required to support our future business, including
capacity expansions and possible acquisitions; (ix) the loss of key customers,
employees or suppliers; (x) the failure to carry out marketing and sales plans;
(xi) the failure to integrate acquired businesses without substantial costs,
delays or other operational or financial problems; (xii) economic, business and
regulatory conditions and changes which may affect the level of new investments
and purchases made by customers, including general economic and business
conditions that are less favorable than expected; and (xiii) domestic and
international political and economic conditions.

        This list of factors that may affect our future performance and
financial and competitive position and also the accuracy of forward-looking
statements is illustrative, but it is by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all
forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their
inherent uncertainty.

         ----------------------------------------------------

(a)      The Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company was held on May 11,
         2001.

(b)      Not applicable.

(c)      Shareholders of the Company were asked to vote on a proposal to elect
         two Class IV directors. The Board of Directors nominated Leo C. Beebe
         and Edward B. Cloues, II as Class IV directors. There were no other
         nominations. Messrs. Beebe and Cloues were then elected, with the
         result of the vote taken at the Annual Meeting being as follows:

         Leo C. Beebe                                     2,024,223             17,439

</TABLE>

         Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast;
         therefore, votes cast in the election could not be recorded against or
         as an abstention, nor could a broker non-vote be recorded.

         Mr. Beebe died on June 30, 2001 after a brief illness and therefore the
         Board position in Class IV is now vacant.
