             K-TRON REPORTS $ 0.59 PER SHARE THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS

Pitman, New Jersey - - November 3, 2004 - - K-Tron International, Inc.
(NASDAQ-KTII) today reported third quarter 2004 net income of $1.562 million, or
$0.59 per share (diluted), on revenues of $28.64 million compared to net income
of $0.910 million, or $0.36 per share (diluted), on revenues of $22.16 million
for the same period in 2003.

For the first nine months of 2004, K-Tron reported net income of $4.373 million,
or $1.68 per share (diluted), on revenues of $82.03 million compared to net
income of $2.610 million, or $1.05 per share (diluted), on revenues of $68.22
million for the same period in 2003.

In announcing the above results, the Company pointed out that if the average
foreign currency exchange rates for the third quarter and first nine months of
2003 were applied to the same periods in 2004, the Company's revenues would have
increased approximately 24.3 percent for the third quarter of 2004 instead of
29.3 percent and would have increased approximately 16.2 percent for the first
nine months of 2004 instead of 20.2 percent, in each case compared to the
numbers reported for the same periods in 2003, and the gains in its net income
and earnings per share in those periods in 2004 would have been lower than
reported. This is due in each case to a significantly weaker U.S. dollar against
the Swiss franc, the euro and other relevant foreign currencies in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2004 compared to the same periods in 2003.

Commenting on the Company's results, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Edward B. Cloues, II said, "K-Tron turned in another excellent performance in
the third quarter of 2004, which marked the tenth consecutive quarter in which
the Company's net income and earnings per share exceeded the comparable numbers
in the prior year period. Third quarter revenues were up 29.3 percent versus the
same quarter a year ago, while net income and earnings per share increased by
71.6 percent and 63.9 percent, respectively. For the first nine months of 2004,
the Company's revenues, net income and earnings per share were up 20.2 percent,
67.5 percent and 60.0 percent, respectively, over the same period last year.
This sharply improved performance for both the third quarter and first nine
months of 2004 was primarily due to stronger demand so far this year for our
feeding, pneumatic conveying, size reduction and other material handling
equipment."

In addition to his comments on financial results, Mr. Cloues noted that the
Company had improved its cash position by $2.134 million in the third quarter,
from $8.510 million to $10.644 million. At the same time, total debt was reduced
by $1.269 million, from $27.112 million to $25.843 million, while net debt (debt
minus cash) declined by $3.403 million, or 18.3 percent, from $18.602 million to
$15.199 million.

K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries design, produce, market and
service material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industrial
markets. The Company has manufacturing facilities in the United States,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada, and its equipment is sold throughout
the world.
