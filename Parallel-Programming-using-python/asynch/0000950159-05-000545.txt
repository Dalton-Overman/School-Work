                  K-TRON REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

Pitman, New Jersey - - May 4, 2005 - - K-Tron International, Inc. (NASDAQ-KTII)
today reported first quarter 2005 net income of $1.643 million, or $0.61 per
share (diluted), on revenues of $28.55 million compared to net income of $1.422
million, or $0.55 per share (diluted), on revenues of $26.32 million for the
same period in 2004.

In announcing these results, the Company pointed out that approximately 28.5
percent of the $2.23 million revenue increase in the first quarter of 2005
compared to the same period in 2004 was from foreign exchange.

Commenting on the Company's results, K-Tron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Edward B. Cloues, II said, "K-Tron posted record first quarter net income and
earnings per share, while our $25.84 million backlog at the end of the quarter
was up 20.1 percent from $21.51 million at the end of 2004 on a constant foreign
exchange basis. First quarter revenues were 8.5 percent higher than the same
quarter a year ago, while net income and earnings per share increased by 15.5
percent and 10.9 percent. Results for the first quarter of last year benefited
from the sale of a small Company-owned office building in England which produced
$164 thousand of income before income taxes. Excluding the gain on that sale,
income before income taxes would have increased from $1.897 million in the first
quarter of 2004 to $2.528 million in the first quarter of 2005, or 33.3 percent.

K-Tron's first quarter year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to
stronger business conditions and increased spending by our customers in the
Americas, especially with respect to our size reduction business line, and also
by customers of our pneumatic conveying business line, which more than offset
lower spending by overseas customers of our feeding business line. Part of our
revenue growth was also due to the positive effect of a weaker U.S. dollar on
the translation of foreign revenues into U.S. dollars."

In addition to his comments on financial results, Mr. Cloues said that the
Company's total debt, all of which was in U.S. dollars, was reduced by $1.45
million in the first quarter of 2005 from $22.78 million to $21.33 million,
while cash decreased by $759 thousand to $11.68 million. Of

the $759 thousand cash reduction, $554 thousand was due to an unfavorable change
in foreign exchange rates during the first quarter. As a result of debt
declining more than cash did, net debt (debt minus cash) decreased by $690
thousand during the first quarter of 2005, from $10.34 million at the end of
2004 to $9.65 million at the end of the 2005 first quarter.

K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries design, produce, market and
service material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industrial
markets. The Company has manufacturing facilities in the United States,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada, and its equipment is sold throughout
the world.
