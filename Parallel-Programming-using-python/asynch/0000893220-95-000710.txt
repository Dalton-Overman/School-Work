1.   Basis of Presentation
     ---------------------

     The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
     accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of
     the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
     principles for complete financial statements.  The consolidated financial
     statements include the accounts of K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron" or
     the "Company") and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have
     been eliminated in consolidation.  In the opinion of management, all
     adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary
     for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have been made.
     The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
     results for a full year.

     The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction
     with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
     31, 1994 which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
     Commission.


2.   Disposition of Business
     -----------------------

     On June 23, 1995, subsidiaries of the Company sold Colortronic GmbH and
     rights to several related patents and patent applications to an investment
     group for $9 million.

     The Swiss banks have not yet allocated $5,150,000 of the proceeds to
     specific debt outstanding, but are expected to do so in the near future.
     Accordingly, this amount has been reflected as a reduction to notes
     payable to banks in the accompanying balance sheet as of September 30,
     1995.

     The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $10,529,000 on the disposition.

     The Company has generated a significant tax loss carry forward due to the
     sale of Colortronic GmbH.  In the second quarter the Company recorded a
     $1,550,000 tax benefit relating to this loss based upon the existence of
     deferred tax liabilities which no longer will be required and estimates of
     future income.  The Company has set up a valuation allowance of
     approximately half of the tax benefit associated with the sale.

ITEM 2.                 K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC.
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                      NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995

Financial Condition
- -------------------

     As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1994, the Company and its U.S. manufacturing subsidiary
are in default under several financial covenants contained in their loan
agreement with three U.S. banks.  These defaults are continuing and have not
been waived.  However, on April 28, 1995, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries
entered into a forbearance agreement with the U.S. banks in which such banks
agreed to forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the loan
documents.  On June 22, 1995 this agreement was amended and extended through
the earlier of February 28, 1996 or the occurrence of a new event of default
thereunder.  See subsequent discussion of the effect of a default under Swiss
loan agreements.  The forbearance agreement also modified the existing loan
documents in certain aspects, including the granting of additional collateral.
At September 30, 1995, the principal amount outstanding under the Company's
U.S. loan agreement was $9.4 million.

     On June 23, 1995, subsidiaries of K-Tron sold Colortronic GmbH and rights
to several related patents and patent applications to an investment group for
$9 million.  The group included two K-Tron executives, including its president
and CEO.  Both subsequently resigned their K-Tron positions, and Leo C. Beebe,
K-Tron's chairman, assumed the duties of chief executive officer.

     The pro forma results of K-Tron without Colortronic are shown below:

*Excluding the after-tax loss on sale of Colortronic of $8.979 million.

     The Colortronic divestiture generated a pre-tax loss of $10.529 million.
This loss was primarily a non-cash write-off of goodwill.  The tax loss carry
forward generated by the sale can be used to offset future cash tax payments.
As a result of the sale of Colortronic GmbH, K-Tron's debt decreased by $24.2
million as of July 1, 1995.

     The loss on the sale of Colortronic caused K-Tron's Swiss subsidiary's
equity to fall below the equity guarantees in its loan agreements with Swiss
banks.  As a result, the subsidiary is in default and these loans have been
reclassified as short-term.

     The subsidiary is currently negotiating a revised financing agreement with
the Swiss banks, but there can be no assurance that a new agreement will be
entered into or that the Swiss banks will not demand payment of their loans.
Furthermore, such equity violation is a new event of default under the
Company's U.S. loan agreement described above.  At September 30, 1995, the
principal amount outstanding under the Swiss loan agreements was $31.0 million.

     The Company is seeking alternative debt or equity financing.  At this
time, the Company has not obtained commitments, and its ability to continue as
a going concern depends on the future availability of its existing credit
facilities or replacement lines of credit, or the raising of cash through the
sale of assets or additional equity.  If the Company is unsuccessful in these
efforts, it may be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner, making it
necessary to undertake such other actions as may be appropriate to preserve
asset values.

Results of Operations

     K-Tron is an international company with two-thirds of its business arising
from sources outside the United States, primarily Europe.  As such, the

    Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of operations
into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates,
particularly with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark.  Revenues
and earnings for the first nine months of 1995 were affected by changes in the
average U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and average U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark exchange
rates, as follows:

    Without Colortronic revenues in 1994, total revenues for the third quarter
of 1995 increased by $4.8 million or 27.1% ($3.3 million or 17.5% when using
constant foreign exchange rates) and $15.6 million or 31.2% for the first nine
months of 1995 ($8.7 million or 15.3% when using constant foreign exchange
rates) versus the same periods in 1994.  Total revenues increased due to the
strong European and United States backlog at the end of the 1995 second
quarter, continued strong 1995 new order inflow and the effect of a weaker U.S.
dollar relative to the Swiss franc and Deutsche mark.

    Gross margin as a percent of revenues improved to 40.9% in the third
quarter of 1995 as compared to 40.6% for the same period in 1994.  Gross margin
declined to 37.8% for the first nine months of 1995 as compared to 40.5% for
the same period in 1994.  The improvement in the margin in the third quarter of
1995 was due to margin improvement in the United States and the sale of the
Colortronic business which had low margins, offset in part by an increase in
warranty costs and the inability to pass on increased costs caused by the
appreciation of the Swiss franc to customers in certain European countries.
The decline in the margin for the first nine months of 1995 was primarily due
to heavily discounted orders booked in 1994, as well as the inability to pass
on increased costs caused by the appreciation of the Swiss franc to customers
in certain European countries.

    Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $.8 million
or 9.8% in the third quarter of 1995 while increasing by $3.6 million or 15.3%
for the first nine months of 1995 as compared to the same periods in 1994.
The decrease in SG&A in the third quarter is due to the elimination of
Colortronic expenses in the third quarter of 1995 offset by higher foreign
exchange translation rates.  The increase for the nine months was primarily due
to higher foreign exchange translation rates as well as to higher commissions
and selling expenses related to the increased sales volume.  In addition, the
Company incurred costs related to the forbearance agreement and costs related
to the Company's efforts to arrange new financing or sell assets.  As a percent
of revenues, SG&A was 33.5% in the third quarter of 1995 and 31.9% for the
first nine months of 1995 as compared to 31.4% and 32.5%,respectively, for the
same periods in 1994.  The change in SG&A as a percent of revenues in 1995 was
primarily due to the change in revenues.

    Research and development (R&D) expenditures in the third quarter and first
nine months of 1995 decreased $.7 million and $.8 million as compared to the
same periods in 1994 due to the elimination of Colortronic brand expenses in
the third quarter of 1995, offset in part by redirection of existing resources
to the remaining brands and higher foreign exchange translation rates.  R&D
expense as a percent of revenues was 2.4% in third


                                      -9-
<PAGE>   12
quarter 1995 and 2.9% for the first nine months of 1995 as compared to 4.6% and
4.5% respectively in 1994.  The decrease in R&D as a percent of revenues in
1995 was due to the reductions noted above and to the change in revenues.

    Interest expense decreased in the third quarter of 1995 by $.4 million as
compared to the same period in 1994 due to lower debt levels following the sale
of Colortronic, offset in part by higher effective interest rates in the United
States and higher foreign exchange translation rates.  Interest expense
increased for the first nine months of 1995 as compared to the same period in
1994 due to increased debt levels in Europe prior to the sale of Colortronic,
higher effective interest rates in the United States and higher foreign
exchange translation rates.

    The Company has generated a significant tax loss carry forward due to the
sale of Colortronic GmbH.  In the second quarter of 1995 the Company recorded a
$1,550,000 tax benefit relating to this loss based upon the existence of
deferred tax liabilities which no longer will be required and estimates of
future income.  The Company has set up a valuation allowance of approximately
half of the tax benefit associated with the sale.

    The backlog of orders excluding Colortronic GmbH increased at the end of
the third quarter of 1995 by 15.8% as compared to the same period in 1994
(using September 30, 1995 foreign exchange translation rates for both
calculations), primarily due to the European recovery from recession and
continued good bookings in the United States.

    Total debt decreased since year end 1994 by $18.6 million despite a $5.9
million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.  Total debt
without the effect of the foreign exchange translation decreased by $24.6
million.  The debt reduction associated with the sale of Colortronic was $24.2
million.  The Company had used all of its available borrowing facilities as of
September 30, 1995.

    At the end of the third quarter of 1995 the Company had a deficit in
working capital of $15.4 million and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was .76. As explained earlier, the change in working capital was
heavily affected by reclassifying $24.3 million of Swiss bank debt from long
term to short term debt.

    Operating activities provided $2.5 million in positive cash flow for the
first nine months of 1995 as compared to using $1.6 million in the same period
of 1994. In the third quarter of 1995, $2.6 million of cash was provided from
operations primarily from profits generated in the quarter and improved asset
management.

    Cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 1995 was
primarily due to the funds received from the sale of Colortronic GmbH and
rights to several related patents and patent applications.

    Cash used in finance activities for the first nine months of 1995 was
primarily the result of using the proceeds from the sale of Colortronic GmbH
and the cash provided by operating activities to reduce bank debt.

    Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Swiss
franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease (after the
elimination of the cumulative translation adjustments associated with the
Colortronic sale) in shareholders' equity of $.3 million in the first nine
months of 1995.

                          PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION



Item 3.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities
         -------------------------------

    As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1994, the Company and its U.S. manufacturing subsidiary are
in default under several financial covenants contained in their loan agreement
with three U.S. banks.  These defaults are continuing and have not been waived.
However, on April 28, 1995, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries entered into
a forbearance agreement with the U.S. banks in which such banks agreed to
forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the loan documents.
On June 22, 1995 this agreement was amended and extended through the earlier of
February 28, 1996 or the occurrence of a new event of default thereunder. The
forbearance agreement also modified the existing loan documents in certain
aspects, including the granting of additional collateral.  At September 30,
1995, the principal amount outstanding under the Company's U.S. loan agreement
was $9.4 million.

    The loss on the sale of Colortronic caused K-Tron's Swiss subsidiary's
equity to fall below the equity guarantees in its loan agreements with Swiss
banks.  As a result, the subsidiary is in default and these loans have been
reclassified as short-term.

    The subsidiary is currently negotiating a revised financing agreement with
the Swiss banks, but there can be no assurance that a new agreement will be
entered into or that the Swiss banks will not demand payment of their loans.
Furthermore, such equity violation is a new event of default under the
Company's U.S. loan agreement described above.  At September 30, 1995, the
principal amount outstanding under the Swiss loan agreements was $31.0 million.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

              October 6, 1995.

         (b)  Not applicable.

         (c)) Shareholders of the Company were asked to vote on the election of
              one Class II director.  The Board of Directors, acting on the

              Annual Meeting were as follows:

              Since directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, a

              election could not be recorded against or as an abstention, nor
              could a broker non-vote be recorded.
