<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC has enacted a rule which mandates that all listed companies
become eligible to participate in the Direct Registration System (&#147;DRS&#148;) no later than January&nbsp;1,
2008. DRS enables investors to maintain securities electronically on the books of a transfer agent
or issuer, and allows for the electronic transfer of securities. To meet the DRS requirements, on
December&nbsp;17, 2007, the Board of Directors of K-Tron International, Inc. (&#147;K-Tron&#148;) amended and
restated K-Tron&#146;s By-laws to permit the issuance and transfer of uncertificated shares.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the Amended and Restated By-laws is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;3.1 to this report and is

advancement of expenses as provided under this Article&nbsp;X, except with respect to indemnification
for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933 which the corporation has undertaken to submit to
a court for adjudication, shall be decided only by arbitration in the City of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania (or such other metropolitan area to which the corporation&#146;s principal executive

director or executive officer of a corporation whose shares of common stock were listed during at

quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System. The party or
parties challenging the right of an indemnified representative to the benefits of this Article&nbsp;X
shall have the burden of proof. The corporation shall reimburse an indemnified representative for
the expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements) incurred in successfully prosecuting or
defending such arbitration. Any award entered by the arbitrators shall be final, binding and
non-appealable and judgment may be entered thereon by any party in accordance with applicable law
in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be specifically
enforceable.
