                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 October 3, 1998
                                   (Unaudited)

1.       Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of K-Tron International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("K-Tron" or the "Company").
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have
been made. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 1998 which
was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash paid in the first
nine months of 1998 and 1997 for interest was $.5 million and $1.0 million,
respectively, and for income taxes was $1.7 million and $1.5 million,
respectively.

3.       Earnings per Share

In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128
requires that the Company report Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share. Basic
Earnings Per Share represents net income less preferred dividends divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted Earnings Per Share is
calculated similarly, except that the denominator includes weighted average
common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of options, warrants,
convertible securities and other instruments with dilutive effects if exercised
or converted.

The Company's Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share are calculated as follows:

4.       Impact of New Accounting Pronouncement

In the first quarter of 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", which
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and
its components. Comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other
non-owner changes in equity. For the three and nine month periods ended October
3, 1998 and September 27, 1997, the following table sets forth the Company's
comprehensive income:

ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
          FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Results of Operations

         For the third quarter and first nine months of 1998, the Company
reported net income of $1,578,000 and $4,700,000 respectively, compared to
$1,461,000 and $3,763,000 in the same periods in 1997.

         K-Tron is an international company with approximately 59% of its
revenues derived from products manufactured and services performed from its
facilities outside the United States, primarily in Europe. As such, the
financial position and performance of the Company is sensitive to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange rates").

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

         Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of operations
into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly
with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark. In addition, revenues and
income of the Company with respect to particular transactions may be affected by
changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in other currencies,
including in particular the U.S.

         Total revenues decreased by $.5 million or 2.5% in the third quarter of
1998 and increased by $.2 million or 0.3% in the first nine months of 1998 when
compared to the same periods in 1997. If the average foreign exchange rate
translation for the third quarter and first nine months of 1998 were applied to
the same periods in 1997, revenues would have decreased 3.0% for the quarter and
increased 1.4% for first nine months. The third quarter 1998 revenue decline was
primarily due to reduced sales in Asia and Russia.

         Gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to 44.7% in the third
quarter of 1998 and improved to 45.3% for the first nine months of 1998, as
compared to 45.8% and 44.9%, respectively, for the same periods in 1997. The
change in gross margin in 1998 was primarily due to changes in the sales mix.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $.6
million or 8.0% in the third quarter of 1998 and by $.5 million or 2.5% for the
first nine months of 1998, as compared to the same periods in 1997. The decrease
in SG&A was primarily due to lower general administrative expenses.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures remained constant for the
third quarter and first nine months of 1998, as compared to the same periods in
1997. R&D expenses increased for the nine months of 1998 in local currencies due
to the development of new product enhancements, but these increases were offset
by lower foreign exchange rate translation.

         Interest expense decreased by $.1 million or 40.9% for the third
quarter of 1998 and by $.4 million or 43.0% for the first nine months of 1998,
as compared to the same periods in 1997, primarily due to lower debt levels,
lower interest rates on some loans and lower foreign exchange rate translation.

         The effective tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of
1998 were 28.6% and 26.4%, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 26.5% for the
same periods in 1997.

         The backlog increased by 32.0% at the end of the third quarter when
compared to the end of 1997 and increased by 28.9% when compared to the end of
the third quarter in 1997, in each case at constant foreign exchange rates.

         In June 1998, the Company's U.S. manufacturing subsidiary refinanced
its bank debt. The new loan facilities consist of a mortgage loan with a maximum
availability of $2.7 million and a two year secured revolving credit facility
with maximum availability of $5.0 million. As of October 3, 1998, outstanding
debt was $2.7 million (interest at 7.625% per annum) under the mortgage loan and
$.8 million (interest at U.S. prime) under the revolving credit facility. In
July 1998, the Company repurchased 250,000 shares of its common stock,
representing approximately 7.7% of its outstanding common stock. The purchase
price of $4,531,250, or $18.125 per share, was funded by a combination of cash
in the amount of $1,981,250 and U.S. bank borrowings of $2,550,000.

         Total debt decreased by $.9 million in the first nine months of 1998,
and this decrease would have been $1.5 million using a constant foreign exchange
rate. European debt decreased by $2.0 million ($2.6 million at a constant
foreign exchange rate) and U.S. debt increased by $1.1 million. At October 3,
1998, the Company had $4.2 million of availability under its U.S. loan
agreements and $4.4 million of availability under its Swiss loan agreements.

         At October 3, 1998, there was working capital of $11.3 million as
compared to $9.4 million at January 3, 1998, and the ratio of current assets to
current liabilities at those dates was 1.45 and 1.41, respectively.

         In the first nine months of 1998 and 1997, the Company utilized
earnings from operations and internally-generated funds to meet its working
capital needs and reduce debt.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.9 million in the first
nine months of 1998 as compared to $9.5 million in the same period of 1997. The
lower operating cash flow was primarily from an increase in accounts receivable
and inventories.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 1998
and 1997 was for capital additions.

         Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 1998
was for the reduction of debt and purchase of treasury shares and was provided
by operating activities and bank borrowings.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment increase in
shareholders' equity of $.8 million in the first nine months of 1998.

Year 2000 Compliance

         The Company has substantially completed an evaluation of its
information technology infrastructure for Year 2000 compliance and is now
implementing its Year 2000 compliance strategy. The Company does not expect that
the cost to modify its information technology infrastructure to be Year 2000
compliant will be material to its financial condition or results of operations .
The Company does not anticipate any material disruptions in its operations as a
result of any failure by the Company to be in compliance. The Company is also in
the process of obtaining information concerning the Year 2000 compliance status
of its suppliers and customers, and there can be no assurance that such
suppliers and customers are or will be Year 2000 compliant. In the event that
any of the Company's significant suppliers or customers does not successfully
and timely achieve Year 2000 compliance, the Company's business operations could
be adversely affected.

                               AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO
                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment") is made
and entered into on October 5, 1998 by and between K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC., a
New Jersey corporation ("K-Tron"), and EDWARD B. CLOUES, II, a resident of
Pennsylvania (the "Employee"). This Amendment amends and otherwise modifies the
Employment Agreement ( the "Agreement") dated as of October 6, 1997 by and
between K-Tron and the Employee. Terms used herein that are not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

         WHEREAS, K-Tron and the Employee wish to amend and modify the Agreement
in certain respects, effective as of January 2, 1998.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:

         1. The fifth sentence of Section 1.4 of the Agreement shall be deemed
modified in the following respects: (a) the term life insurance policy having a
death benefit of $1,000,000 shall be in addition to any group term life
insurance which the Employee may be required to accept under any K-Tron group
plan, and K-Tron shall reimburse the Employee for the estimated income taxes on
the premiums paid for such $1,000,000 policy; and (b) the Employee and K-Tron
acknowledge that the disability coverage referred to in Section 1.4 shall be
satisfied by the QQ series Disability Income Policy in a lesser amount, with a
one year waiting period, which the Employee has purchased from Northwestern
Mutual Life.

         2. Section 1.5 of the Agreement is amended and restated to read in its
entirety as follows:

          "1.5 Stock Grant. On January 2, 1998, K-Tron shall issue to the
     Employee 10,000 fully vested shares of its Common Stock, which shares shall
     be unregistered and contain an appropriate securities law restrictive
     legend. On October 7, 1998, K-Tron shall issue to the Employee 7,500 shares
     (the "October Shares") of its Common Stock as a restricted stock grant
     under Section 6 of the K-Tron International, Inc. 1996 Equity Compensation
     Plan, as amended (the "1996 Equity Compensation Plan"), with the grant to
     provide that the restrictions shall lapse on January 5, 1999, provided that
     the Employee is still employed by K-Tron on that date. On January 5, 1999,
     K-Tron shall issue to the Employee 12,500 shares of its Common Stock as a
     restricted stock grant under Section 6 of the 1996 Equity Compensation
     Plan, with the grant to provide that 2,500 of such shares shall be fully
     vested shares on that date and that the restrictions shall lapse as to the
     other 10,000 shares (the "January 2000 Shares") on January 5, 2000,
     provided that the Employee is still employed by K-Tron on those dates.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions on the October Shares and
     the January 2000 Shares shall lapse immediately if the Employment Term is
     terminated by (a) K-Tron for any reason other than "cause" as defined in
     Section 8.4(b) hereof or (b) the Employee either pursuant to Section 8.4(a)
     hereof or in


<PAGE>   2



     connection with a Termination upon a Change of Control as described in
     Section 9.1(c) hereof."

         3. This Amendment shall be effective as of January 2, 1998 and shall be
governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of New Jersey, without
giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions.

         4. As amended and modified hereby, the Agreement is ratified and
confirmed in all respects.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, K-Tron and the Employee have executed this
Amendment on October 5, 1998.
