         Diluted earnings per common share are based on the weighted average
         number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during a
         given time period. Such average shares include the weighted average
         number of common shares outstanding plus the shares issuable upon
         exercise of stock options after the assumed repurchase of common shares
         with the related proceeds.

7.    Goodwill

      The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
      142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on December 30, 2001. As
      required by SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional
      impairment test on goodwill, which resulted in no impairment charge.

      The Company has reassessed the balance sheet classification, useful lives
      and residual values of all acquired intangible assets. No adjustments or
      reclassifications were required by this reassessment, and only goodwill
      was determined to have an indefinite life. Goodwill amortization in fiscal
      2001 was $345 thousand on an after-tax basis, or $0.14 per share. Goodwill
      amortization for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2001 was
      $67 thousand and $322 thousand, respectively, on an after-tax basis, or
      $0.02 per share and $0.13 per share, respectively. Based on these amounts,
      net income and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine
      months ended September 29, 2001, adjusted to eliminate goodwill
      amortization, was $(701) thousand and $(0.30) per share and $1.139 million
      and $0.46 per share, respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      For the third quarter and first nine months of 2002, K-Tron reported net
income of $836 thousand and $2.401 million, respectively, compared to a net loss
of $768 thousand and net income of $817 thousand for the same periods in 2001.
On July 31, 2001, we sold our Hasler heavy feeder business ("Hasler"), recording
a pretax loss of $620 thousand, and on November 30, 2001 we acquired Pneumatic
Conveying Systems Limited ("PCS") in the United Kingdom, which transactions are
more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 29, 2001.

      We are an international company and derived approximately 58% and 59% of
our revenues for the first nine months of 2002 and 2001, respectively, from
products manufactured in, and services performed from, our facilities located
outside the United States, primarily in Europe. Since we operate globally, we
are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates ("foreign exchange
rates"), which can affect both the translation of financial statement items of
foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars as well as transactions where the
revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different
currencies, such as sales made from our Swiss manufacturing facility in
currencies other than the Swiss franc.

      The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a
percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

</TABLE>

      As previously noted, more than half of our revenues are normally derived
from activities in foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, our results can be
significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in
U.S. dollar exchange rates with respect to the Swiss franc, euro and British
pound sterling and, to a lesser degree, the Singapore dollar and other
currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S.
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. dollar
weakens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based
sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based
costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar
strengthens. Overall, since we typically receive a majority of our revenues in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we generally benefit from a weaker dollar
and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies
worldwide, especially those identified above. In particular, a general weakening
of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would positively affect our total
revenues, gross profit and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars
(provided that the gross profit and operating income numbers from foreign
operations are not losses, since in the case of a loss, the effect would be to
increase the loss), whereas a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar against
such currencies would have the opposite effect.

      In addition, our revenues and income with respect to particular
transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales
are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility
manufacturing the product subject to the sale, including in particular the U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc (for inter-company transactions) and the Swiss franc/euro and
Swiss franc/British pound sterling (for sales from the Company's Swiss
manufacturing facility) exchange rates.

      Total revenues increased by $0.8 million or 5.1% in the third quarter of
2002 and decreased by $6.4 million or 11.2% in the first nine months of 2002
compared to the same periods in 2001. Without Hasler, revenues increased by $1.7
million or 11.3% in the third quarter of 2002 and decreased by $1.9 million or
3.7% in the first nine months of 2002 compared to the same periods in 2001. The
decrease in revenues without Hasler for the nine months was driven by declines
in EMEA/Asia and the Americas, due to a weaker global economy with reduced
capital spending in the process industries we serve, partially offset by three
full quarters of revenues from the November 30, 2001 acquisition of PCS and the
positive effect of a weaker U.S. dollar when translating the revenues of foreign
operations. The increase in revenues without Hasler for the third quarter was
due to revenues from PCS and the positive effect of a weaker U.S. dollar,
partially offset by revenue declines in EMEA/Asia. If the average foreign
exchange rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001 were applied
to the same periods of 2002, total revenues for 2002 (excluding Hasler) would
have increased by $0.6 million or 3.6% for the third quarter and decreased by
$3.8 million or 7.3% for the first nine months versus the same periods in 2001.

      Gross profit as percentage of revenues increased to 41.0% for the third
quarter and 42.1% for the first nine months of 2002 compared to 39.6% and 40.3%
for the same periods in 2001. The improvements in gross profit were primarily
due to the change in sales mix as a result of the July 31, 2001 sale of the
Hasler business and a reduction in fixed costs, including the elimination of
goodwill expense as the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on December 30, 2001.
Goodwill amortization for the three months and nine months ended September 29,
2001 was $67 thousand and $322 thousand, respectively.

      Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $0.9
million or 14.9% ($0.6 million or 11.1% without Hasler) for the third quarter
and by $2.7 million or 14.9% ($1.1 million or 6.8% without Hasler) for the first
nine months of 2002 compared to the same periods in 2001. These decreases in
SG&A were primarily due to lower commissions on the reduced revenues for the
nine months, fewer employees, the elimination of Hasler SG&A after the sale of
Hasler on July 31, 2001 and the benefits realized from one-time costs associated
with cost reductions implemented in the third quarter of 2001, offset in part by
higher foreign exchange translation rates (weaker U.S. dollar). SG&A expense as
a percent of total revenues was 29.9% for the third quarter and 30.9% for the
first nine months of 2002 compared to 36.9% and 32.2% for the same periods in
2001.

      Research and development (R&D) expenditures were essentially constant for
the third quarter of 2002 and decreased by $198 thousand or 9.5% for the first
nine months of 2002, compared to the same periods in 2001. R&D expenses
decreased for the first nine months due to lower staff costs, partially offset
by an increase in tooling costs and by higher foreign exchange translation rates
(weaker U.S. dollar). R&D expense as a percent of total revenues was 3.6% for
the third quarter and 3.8% for the first nine months of 2002 compared to 3.9%
and 3.7% for the same periods in 2001.

      Interest expense decreased by $152 thousand or 59.4% for the third quarter
and by $436 thousand or 51.8% for the first nine months of 2002 compared to the
same periods in 2001, primarily due to lower interest rates and debt reductions
of $2.6 million in Switzerland ($3.2 million at constant foreign exchange rates)
and $2.0 million in the U.S.

      Income before income taxes was $1.2 million for the third quarter and $3.4
million for the first nine months of 2002 compared to a loss of $1.1 million and
income of $1.0 million for the same periods in 2001. The changes from
year-to-year were the result of the items discussed above, with the third
quarter and first nine months of 2002 income before income taxes improving
versus a year ago, despite lower revenues for the nine months, primarily as a
result of the Hasler sale and the globalization and cost reduction initiatives
which we implemented during the latter half of 2001.

      The effective tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of
2002 were 28.7% and 28.4% compared to 28.4% (benefit) and 22.0% for the same
periods in 2001. The higher effective tax rates in 2002 were primarily due to
the increase in foreign taxable income in 2002 as compared to 2001, which
included the loss on the sale of the Hasler business. On July 1, 2002, New
Jersey approved legislation for corporation income tax reform. The changes made
to the law accounted for an increase in the tax provision for the first nine
months of 2002 of approximately $60 thousand after the related federal income
tax benefit.

      The order backlog decreased by 18.8% at the end of the third quarter of
2002 compared to year-end 2001 and by 8.0% compared to the end of the third
quarter of 2001, in each case at constant foreign exchange rates. The decrease
from the end of 2001 was primarily the result of lower orders received at our
facility in Switzerland in the first nine months of 2002, while the decrease
from the end of the third quarter of 2001 was the result of both lower orders
received at our facility in Switzerland and the fact that the third quarter 2001
backlog did not include orders received by PCS which was acquired on November
30, 2001.

</TABLE>

      Total debt decreased by $4.6 million in the first nine months of 2002, or
by $5.2 million when adjusted to a constant foreign exchange rate, with debt
decreasing by $2.6 million in Switzerland ($3.2 million at constant foreign
exchange rates) and $2.0 million in the U.S. At September 28, 2002, we had $5.0
million of unused borrowing availability under our U.S. revolving credit
agreement and $6.0 million of unused borrowing availability under our foreign
loan agreements. In July 2002, the $5.0 million U.S. revolving credit agreement
was extended through July 2004.

      At September 28, 2002, working capital was $14.0 million compared to $15.6
million at December 29, 2001, and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities at those dates was 1.88 and 2.18, respectively.

      In the first nine months of 2002 and 2001, we utilized internally
generated funds to meet our working capital needs.

      Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.6 million in the first
nine months of 2002 compared to $4.3 million in the same period of 2001. The
increase in operating cash flow during the first nine months of 2002 compared to
the same period in 2001 was primarily due to higher income, a reduction in
inventory and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in
prepaid expenses, a reduction in accounts receivable and lower amortization.

      Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2002 and
2001 was primarily for capital additions. In 2001, capital additions were
partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Hasler business.

      Cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2002 and
2001 was for debt reduction.

      Of the total increase in shareholders' equity of $4.4 million in the first
nine months of 2002, $1.9 million was attributable to changes in foreign
exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the Swiss franc and euro
versus the U.S. dollar.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS

      The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides
a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We and
our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that
are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this report and other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to our shareholders
and news releases. All statements that express expectations, estimates,
forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Act. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute
forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as
"expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates,"
"projects," "forecasts," "may," " should," variations of such words and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted
in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
statements contained in this report include statements regarding the effect of
changes in foreign exchange rates on our business and the effect of recent New
Jersey tax legislation. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

      A wide range of factors could materially affect our future performance and
financial and competitive position, including the following: (i) increasing
price and product/service competition by domestic and foreign competitors,
including new entrants; (ii) the mix of products/services sold by us; (iii)
rapid technological changes and developments and our ability to continue to
introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost-effective basis; (iv)
changes in U.S. and global financial and currency markets, including significant
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; (v) protection
and validity of patent and other intellectual

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
property rights held by us and our competitors; (vi) the cyclical nature of our
business as a capital goods supplier; (vii) possible future litigation and
governmental proceedings; (viii) the availability of financing and financial
resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support our
future business, including capacity expansions and possible acquisitions; (ix)
the loss of key customers, employees or suppliers; (x) the failure to carry out
marketing and sales plans; (xi) the failure to integrate acquired businesses
without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems;
(xii) economic, business and regulatory conditions and changes which may affect
the level of new investments and purchases made by customers, including general
economic and business conditions that are less favorable than expected; (xiii)
domestic and international political and economic conditions; and (xiv) the
outcome of any legal proceeding in which we are involved.

      These factors which may affect our future performance and financial and
competitive position and also the accuracy of any forward-looking statements
should be evaluated with an understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

      An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
      disclosure controls and procedures was recently conducted under the
      supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
      chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on that
      evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and
      chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and
      procedures were effective as of November 11, 2002. There have been no
      significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that
      could significantly affect these controls subsequent to November 11, 2002.
