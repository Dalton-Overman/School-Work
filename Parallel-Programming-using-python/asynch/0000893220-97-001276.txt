                   K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC. & SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 JUNE 28, 1997
                                  (Unaudited)

1.       Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles
for complete financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron" or the "Company")
and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a
normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation of
results for interim periods have been made.  The results for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.

The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 1996
which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash paid in the
first six months of 1997 and 1996 for interest was $.6 million and $.9 million,
respectively, and for income taxes was $1.2 million and $.6 million,
respectively.

3.       Impact of New Accounting Pronouncement

In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share ("SFAS No. 128") which
requires the Company to present in the financial statements "basic" and
"diluted" earnings per share, as defined.  SFAS No. 128 is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 1997; however, pro forma
"basic" and "diluted" earnings per share as defined for the second quarter and
six month periods ended June 28, 1997 and June 29, 1996 would be, if SFAS No.
128 were adopted for those periods:

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                         SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 28, 1997

  Results of Operations

         For the second quarter and first six months of 1997, the Company
reported net income of $1,252,000 and $2,302,000, respectively, compared to
$928,000 and $1,680,000 in the same periods in 1996.

         K-Tron is an international company with approximately 60% of its
revenues derived from products manufactured and services performed from its
facilities outside the United States, primarily in Europe.  As such, the
financial position and performance of the Company is sensitive to both
translation and transaction fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
("foreign exchange rates").

         The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues:

                 Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of
  operations into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange
  rates, particularly with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark.
  In addition, revenues and income of the Company with respect to particular
  transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales
  are made in other currencies, including in particular the U.S. dollar/Swiss

For the second quarter and first six months of 1997 as well as the same periods
in 1996, the changes in these exchange rates were as follows:

         Total revenues decreased by $.1 million or 0.1%  in the second quarter
of 1997 and by $2.4 million or 5.2% for the first six months of 1997 when
compared to the same periods in 1996.  The decrease in revenues was due to
lower exchange translation rates of certain currencies into U.S. dollars.  If
the average foreign currency exchange rates for the first quarter and first six
months of 1997 were applied to the same periods in 1996, revenues would have
increased 8.9% for the quarter and 4.6% for the first six months.

         Gross margin as a percent of revenues declined to 45% in the second
quarter of 1997 and improved to 44.4% for the first six months of 1997, as
compared to 46.1% and 44.0% for the same periods in 1996.  The change in gross
margin in 1997 was primarily due to sales mix.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $.3
million or 4.6% in the second quarter of 1997 and by $.9 million or 6.0% for
the first six months of 1997, as compared to the same periods in 1996.   The
decrease in SG&A was due to the lower foreign exchange translation rates
previously described.

         Research and development (R&D) expenditures increased by $.1 million
or 10.5% in the second quarter of 1997 and by $.2 million or 14.1% for the
first six months of 1997, as compared to the same periods in 1996.  R&D
expenses increased due to the development of new product enhancements, offset
in part by lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         Interest expense decreased by $.3 million or 45.1% in the second
quarter of 1997 and by $.5 million or 46.2% for the first six months of 1997,
as compared to the same periods in 1996, primarily due to lower debt levels and
lower foreign exchange translation rates.

         The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of
1997 were 27% and 25%, respectively, compared to 37% for the same periods in
1996.  The effective tax rates in the second quarter and first six months of
1997 were lower than the same periods in 1996 due to the utilization of foreign
net operating loss carry forwards.

         The backlog increased by 1.9% at the end of the second quarter of 1997
when compared to the end of 1996 and decreased by 3.3% when compared to the
same period in 1996 (at constant foreign exchange rates).

</TABLE>


         Total debt decreased by $5.9 million in the first six months of 1997,
of which $1.0 million was due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.
Total debt without the effect of the foreign exchange translation decreased by
$4.9 million.  European and U.S. debt decreased by $5.8 million and $.1
million, respectively.  At June 28, 1997, the Company had $4.9 million of
availability under its U.S. revolving credit agreement and $9.2 million of
availability under certain of its Swiss loan agreements.

         At June 28, 1997, there was working capital of $12.7 million as
compared to $15.4 million at December 28, 1996, and the ratio of current assets
to current liabilities at those dates was 1.59 and 1.80, respectively.  Working
capital decreased in 1997 primarily due to the utilization of funds generated
from operations and improved asset management to reduce indebtedness.

         In the first six months of 1997 and 1996, the Company utilized
earnings from operations and internally-generated funds to meet its working
capital needs and reduce debt.

         Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.6 million in the
first six months of 1997 as compared to $6.0 million in the same period of
1996. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to improved
operating profits as well as continued focus on asset management.

         Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 1997
and 1996 was for capital additions.

         Net cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 1997
and 1996 was for the reduction of debt and was obtained from the cash provided
from operating activities.

         Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment decrease in
shareholders' equity of $.7 million in the first six months of 1997.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

(a)      The Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company was held on May 2,
         1997.

(b)      Not applicable.

(c)      Shareholders of the Company were asked to vote on the election of two
         Class IV directors.   The Board of Directors, acting on the
         recommendation of its Nominating Committee, nominated Leo C. Beebe and
         Edward B. Cloues, II as Class IV directors.  There were no other
         nominations.  The result of the vote taken at the Annual Meeting was
         as follows:

         Edward B. Cloues, II           2,654,856                 1,900
</TABLE>


         Since directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, a
         withheld vote had no effect.  In addition, votes cast in the election
         could not be recorded against or as an abstention, nor could a broker
         non-vote be recorded.
