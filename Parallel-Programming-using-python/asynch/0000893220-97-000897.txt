         All documents filed by the Registrant pursuant to Sections 13(a),
13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, after the date of this registration
statement and prior to the filing of a post-effective amendment to this

deemed to be incorporated by reference in this registration statement and to be
part hereof from the date of filing of such documents. Any statement contained
in a document incorporated by reference herein shall be deemed to be modified or
superseded for purposes hereof to the extent that a statement contained herein
(or in any other subsequently filed document that is also incorporated by

<PAGE>   3
ITEM 6.  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

         The By-Laws of the Registrant generally provide for the mandatory
indemnification of directors, officers and other corporate agents to the fullest
extent permitted by the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, as amended
("NJBCA"), as do various indemnification agreements entered into by the Company
and its directors and certain officers.

         The NJBCA generally provides that a New Jersey corporation has the
power to indemnify a director, officer or other agent against his or her
expenses and liabilities in connection with any proceedings involving the
director, officer or agent by reason of his or her being or having been such a
director, officer or agent other than proceedings by or in the right of the
corporation, if such director, officer or agent acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation; and with respect to any criminal proceeding, such
director, officer or agent had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her
conduct was unlawful.

         The indemnification and advancement of expenses shall not exclude any
other rights, including the right to be indemnified against liabilities and
expenses incurred in proceedings by or in the right of the corporation, to which
a director, officer or agent may be entitled under a certificate of
incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or otherwise; provided
that no indemnification shall be made to or on behalf of a director, officer or
agent if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the director, officer
or agent establishes that his or her acts or omissions (a) were in breach of his
or her duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders, (b) were not in
good faith or involved a knowing violation of law or (c) resulted in receipt by
the director, officer or agent of an improper personal benefit.

         In addition, the Registrant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation
provides that directors and officers of the Registrant shall not be personally
liable to the Registrant or its shareholders for damages for breach of any duty
owed to the Registrant or its shareholders, except that a director or officer
shall not be relieved from liability for any breach of duty based upon an act or
omission (a) in breach of such person's duty of loyalty to the Registrant or its
shareholders, (b) not in good faith or involving a knowing violation of law or
(c) resulting in receipt by such person of an improper personal benefit.

         The Registrant has purchased a Directors and Officers indemnity
insurance policy.

ITEM 7.  EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION CLAIMED.

ITEM 9.  UNDERTAKINGS.

         (a)      The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:

                  (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are
being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:

                           (i) To include any prospectus required by Section
         10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;

                           (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events
         arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the
         most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in
         the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
         forth in the registration statement; and

                           (iii) To include any material information with
         respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the
         registration statement or any material change to such information in
         the registration statement;

                  Provided, however, that subparagraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)
of this section do not apply if the information required to be included in a
post-effective amendment by those subparagraphs is contained in periodic reports
filed by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the
registration statement.

                  (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under
the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed
to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered

                                        3
<PAGE>   5
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

                  (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective
amendment any of the securities being registered that remain unsold at the
termination of the offering.

         (b) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for the purpose
of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of
the Registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act (and each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report
pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference
in this registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration
statement relating to the securities offered therein and the offering of such
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering
thereof.

         (c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Re:      K-Tron International, Inc.
         Registration Statement on Form S-8
         Relating to the K-Tron International, Inc. 1996 Equity Compensation
         Plan, as amended

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to K-Tron International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation
(the "Company"), in connection with the preparation of a registration statement
on Form S-8 (the "Registration Statement") to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"),
relating to 450,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per
share (the "Common Stock"), issuable under the K-Tron International, Inc. 1996
Equity Compensation Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). We have examined such
certificates, records, statutes and other documents as we have deemed relevant
in rendering this opinion. As to matters of fact, we have relied on
representations of officers of the Company. In our examination, we have assumed
the genuineness of documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity
with the original of all documents submitted to us as copies thereof.

Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that the shares of Common Stock
issuable under the Plan will be, when issued in accordance with the terms of the
Plan, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock.

The opinion set forth above is limited to the New Jersey Business Corporation
Act, as amended.

We hereby consent to the use of this opinion as Exhibit 5 to the Registration
Statement. In giving such opinion, we do not thereby admit that we are acting
within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the
Act or the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder.

Very truly yours,


/s/ Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP
